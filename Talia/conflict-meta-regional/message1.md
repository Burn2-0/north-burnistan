Something needs to be done... 
This is my sent mail folder since September the 9th..... 
3v replied to one message just before my birthday with "Happy Birthday Talia".

There are a few there that have Replies... From the Bottom up. Danger's "reply" was  bounced mail from using an old address.

The 3v one above that was 3v sending an image of dangers one line email saying that my complaints were to be ignored.. 

The one above where I got a reply from rangers.... That was where 3v's personal email account was overfilled and the warning messages were being sent to the Burn2 Group Email...

The one above that to Skye, 3v. It was Skye answering me. She had to unblock me to actually take that email. She has me blocked. It was her and Leo I'd filed a complaint about 4 days prior to my very suddenly no warning life-time ban with no appeals.  And no I can't explain how the ranger rules state that a ranger will be seriously reprimanded for "Knowingly ignoring a problem" When you block someone that is willfully ignoring some? And if that person is going to be causing an issue?..
 
But in the case of that email. I was reporting the data-breach I had found on the website...335 volunteer usernames tied to their email addresses had been left out in the open for about 4 years... I had felt guilty about the timing and I knew I was by far and away the most experienced person in terms of dealing with GDPR issues, So having reported the issue, explained what was required of them to be compliant, I then even went as far as to write up 14k words worth of the documents that they were missing. 

No reply to my complaint to Regional...... Addressed to Raspa because of the letter he'd sent to Love Burn. Basically saying that if the very same kinda things that.... NO not the same... What is happening at Burn2 is orders of magnitude worse... You have multiple people complaining directly to BRC. Surely, that shows that something is going on? Surely You might want to hear both sides of the story?

Lucky for you I can actually literally let you do that:

And there is a whole lot of info stored on:

I am fastidious about keeping records... I am also the one that has built 7 different metrics systems for burn events. So it was me that established that there was a 39% drop in traffic between the 23 octoburn and the 24 Octoburn. Is that being blamed on me? because I made such a commotion over being banned for life with no appeal...

Betting fingers have been pointed in my direction over that. Thing is... I've only recently come back to Burn2. some time around Sept 23.. Interesting thing about the data-breach.. that was 4 years work of performer and volunteers data, So not just participants but people that went further.... When the breach happened the one thing that iSkye did besides the half assed fix to the security was to put out notices that it had happened. Of the 335 people who have volunteered in some capacity in the last 4 years would you believe that a notice to all the Burn2 groups would have reached only 17% of those on the data breach  list.
Please tell me that that level of volunteer turnover is normal.

Another interesting set of numbers... I did a word count of all the things 3v has said to me.
January whilst we were talking about me becoming RC Asst. We organised an in-world interview the following week, Something happened with 3v and I didn't really see her for several months... 619 words
Next actual correspondence from 3v came in notecard form this was my ban notice.  629 Words
Everything since... from "Hi Talia, please read attached NC" to "Hi Talia happy birthday".... 334 words
My word count over the same time. I've written single messages that exceed her total. I am scared to work out the same.

So, 3v is actually the person I have least complaint with. I think she is just in-between two rocks and a hard place. But 3v does have contracts and requirements. So I am hoping that by pointing out how many rules she's been forced into breaking then something  may actually happen from BRC.

*Takes a deep breath*

Okay, Signing off on Bans. She didn't contact me prior to the notice. no one contacted me about the ban till it happened. 
Regional coord contract: 
"the RC should maintain a neutral stance, collect as much relevant feedback as possible,"
AND 
"Should an RC need help in mediating or working through conflicts, they can escalate to and request the help of the following groups as appropriate: the Conflict Support Meta Regional Subcommittee, Regional Network Team,"
AND
the contract say to use the following as a guide:

Feedback and Complaint Procedures: 
"Review the Regional Contact Role" (Think this email should show that I've been through it with a fine tooth comb),
"Direct Communication: Consider discussing your concerns directly with those involved before filing a complaint. Open and honest communication often resolves issues." It's been me doing all the communications. 3v's total word count of communications in their entirety to me came to nearly 1600 words. My last three email threads to her... come to 4573 words. not including anything external I wrote externally and referenced. That has been since the 4th Nov.

"Prepare your Complaint",  What format do you want the rest of it? I have a list of 121 specific complaints regarding the 10 principles and consent of the hidden 11th. Each of them I have 11  complaints about.... I have an obsidian vault filled with breakdowns and analysis of the more critical incidents.. Or I have a notebookLM that I would put money on being the most complete reference to all things burn2 there is. That is where the podcast comes from. Think I have covered my relationship to 3v. But not so much who I am. My first appearance at a virtual burn was in 08... Where I was put forward as a viable candidate to replace the Lead DPW. Apparently that was a good decision. As I was DPW lead and very quickly core team and ranger before the end of the event. That event was twice the size of the current burn2 event. I was returned the following year where the event grew to 3 times the size of burn2 currently. After that due to personal reasons I needed to take a break from SL as a whole. That break ended up being over 10 years... then there were  a couple years where I was doing other things in sl... so as I said sept 23 I reappeared for Burn2.  Oh and one thing I missed from 09. I was fulfilling the requirements of a 007 ranger... So I know my way around the rules and regulations better than most even with 10 years of dust built up.
"Confidentiality", Ha! It's been 190 ish days since my ban and I've not stopped making noise about it., Pretty sure the confidentiality boat has sailed for me.
"Submit Your Complaint", Well as you can see my emails I am not shy about emailing complaints. THis however is my first to you because I empathise with 3v. she's neurodivergent  I am currently being tested  ((Mostly due the massive confidence loss I've been facing due to what I am sure is RSD brought on in part by  and certainly pushed beyond bearable with by my treatment by burn2)) They we are both Brit's, both sandbox rats, etc. etc. Hehe half of what I send her is just updates.. keeping her in the loop as to what I am up to, Letting her know I am still fighting as my tokerence to depression is almost non-existent ... I am far better at redirecting angry energy into more productive stuff than I am at pulling myself out of depression. 
"Investigation Process
The investigation process may include". Slightly concerning that this isn't a sure thing.:

image.png

"Statements: Burning Man will contact and speak with anyone involved in or named in the complaint.
Follow-Up: Follow-up interviews by phone or email.
In-Person Visits: In rare cases, a member of the Burning Man staff may visit in person to mediate disputes or gather more information."
Well If any of this actually happens I will be surprised. Admittedly, I have written enough to cover statements for everyone who has left since I've been back. But if someone were to actually interview me. I have an ai assisted notebook that I have easily 5 million words inside of..... 

"Failure to uphold the Ten Principles: For example, lack of Radical Inclusion or Civic Responsibility.", 1 document with 121 examples of how . and numerous others....

"Misrepresentation of the RC Role: Inappropriately representing the Regional Contact role as one of authority or governance over others.". I would say that writing and putting her name to At least two ban notices would cover this. I don't think that RC is meant to be the local Leads pet Executioner/Assassin?

"Inactivity: Failure to respond to community inquiries for an extended period." 334 words since signing her name on the bottom of my ban notice. The same ban notice which in the final paragraph stated "Should you wish to discuss this decision further, please feel free to reach out in writing. While the ban is permanent, we are willing to listen to any feedback you may have and provide further explanation if needed."

Just want to reiterate I think 3v is just overwhelmed and in an impossible situation.  She is RC for a Regional  where the SOLE OWNER  is as hands off as possible. relying upon the feedback of a couple of wholly inappropriate leads who time and again have been caught out lying through their teeth. If any one complains they suffer my fate. They goto m2 who rubber stamps anything they want just so long as he's not bothered too much by it. I don't exactly know whether any of the outcomes you have listed could actually do anything. According to the burn2 mini site  M2 is actually a regional contact  too.. He falls foul on more of the complaints that 3v does.

"The Importance of the RC Role

"Regional Contacts, though volunteers, are official representatives of Burning Man Project. They are expected to uphold the Burning Man Principles and positively represent the Burning Man community. The Volunteer Regional Contact Agreement is legally binding, and violations can have serious implications for both the individual and the Burning Man Regional Network. To secure the future of the Burning Man Regional Network, formal steps are necessary to address issues."

So what happens when the sole owner/regional contact restricts freedom of speech? What  happens when they go against a guiding principle of law that has stood the test of millenia? Something that appears in pretty much all human rights treaties and within pretty much all legal systems it features strongly.. ie. Null Crimen...If there isn't a law against something then you can't make up a law in the future and convict people for doing something in the past. Going down that path is a dark dark place.

image.png

As I keep referencing it, I'm going to post my ban notice at the end..

But as a quick rundown . The m2 quote is the first time that was seen. so "Null Crimen".
Not 100% sure what the discord thing is..The two things I think that it could be are the time I said the leads I complained about were acting like fascists, posted the dictionary definition and examples for most of the defining points.. which, yeah, isn't exactly a pleasant thing to hear out loud. But surely it's more concerning how many examples I gave? Or the other thing was when I was saying what a particular situation did to me. Like a victim statement. Either way It's one is one of the things I've consistently asked for clarification on what the incident was that they are referring to.. 
Moving on... discord mod warning... lie... I got a friendly unofficial warning from Freia who went from being one of the leads, a senior ranger and discord mod... Well I spoke with her this morning. She's currently of the opinion that burn2 is too far gone.. too broken to fix.. and she is distancing herself.. The straw that broke the camel's back for her was having works put into her mouth that were then used to attempt to back someone. 
Meeting Topic disruptions... i.e. there was a heated debate at the beginning of one meeting  when I had tried to submit 6-7 agenda points... First they say there is a rule about a single point per meeting.  That is not a rule... that was advice given to me by puddles.. I might have complained about it like it was a rule. That was more the frustration of the level of bureaucracy that had appeared at b2.. So yeah not a rule. What is a rule is that if a topic gets truncated then it takes priority in the following meeting. So How did I get 6 resubs if Those should have taken priority in the following meets.
That last one... disruption to community harmony... That is almost insulting. Find out who pretty much got lynch mobbed... Look at who did the effigy burn.. which was highly acclaimed.. It was a lot more than the burns previous by all accounts... There was certainly a great deal of bewilderment when the build produced a storyboard... The burn wasn't just Oh I built a thing that follows the theme and made it flammable. . That burn had the 10 principles woven through every pixel, that builder knew things were bad and what doing all they could way can then to try bring the community together and work to a common goal. You have one guess of who that builder was.

Soo,  how justified is a Lifetime ban with no appeal. No mediation, No punitive measures, No Notifications, No chance to speak, No chance to defend myself, No chance for others to speak in defence, No way for people to complain internally without fear of Retaliation.

The way things went down with my ban... Leo recused herself as was appropriate. However she then went on to pick the 007 rangers then she provided with all the information they apparently needed... But they didn't reach consensus rather than give them more time to deliberate. Leo seemed to think this was such a high priority that she Just took the decision away from them. She then went to M2, where once again she had control over the information and this time it was just one person to convince. And obviously that time she succeeded.  Which really brings into question if she could be considered recused..? She was in complete control over who made the decision and what information they had at their disposal.
She obviously felt she was conflicted enough to have pretended to recuse. But when it looked like she might not get her way..she obviously had to take over because everyone was about to make such a grave mistake that would result in her having to be accountable to the complaint I had put in against her. 
My current theory on this. She's not really scared of my one complaint. What she is scared of is that if people were to find out that there was a successful complaint that had not resulted in the complainant being banned she would then be buried alive under the avalanche that would follow. 
But the way things are not it's Leo/iSkye's way or the highway, and as I mentioned 39% drop in traffic. Please tell me how that can be spun so that they are not making a mockery of the principles. 

image.png

So before I get too carried away.... I am aware this is a long email already. The problem is that the longer they bury their heads in the playa dust over this, the more they attempt to sweep me under the rug..  ((pg 33 rangers manual)) .. The more it makes it feel like they are in the wrong. and I am justified in chasing this. 
I have outright told them that if they can explain to me how my ban is justified in a logical way that makes sense, with evidence to back it up. That doesn't rely on fabrication and putting lies into the mouths of others. I could use that to cut myself loose. Their answer to that is to try to ignore me. 

Unless something is done about this Burn2 is basically finished. Their traffic stats are tanking. 2/5th of their traffic for their largest event. I think that would have been worse were it not for two things.
* iSkye had to beg a group called Organica to come. Organica is a psytrance camp who consistently pull in big crowds. They had DJ's refuse to play and their stats were way down compared to usual and they struggle to find DJs to play a sound camp it's normally an honour to. 
* There "was" no alternative. There is a new event now, called "the gathering". It's got some similarities to Burn2. Certainly enough for people to see it as a viable alternative. Based on the recent events stats. if there was a decent alternative "lifeboat" event. Then I am guessing that 39% could easily have doubled. . 

Okay.... I am going to pause here... And hope this is enough to open a conversation with you...
All I am looking to get here is to be able to be involved with something that is worthy of being proud to be a part of again... 

Best Regards.. 
TT


Below this point is the ban notice I mentioned...

Dear Talia Tokugawa,
Subject: Burn2 Membership Status

I regret to inform you of an important decision that has been made regarding your membership in Burn2. After escalation of recent events following the ban of the avatar DJ Puddles, Burn2 SIM owner & Burn2 Discord owner, M2, has decided to impose a permanent ban on Talia Tokugawa, Sally27 and Bearded Lady.

"When a ban is placed on an avatar, it is a result of the behavior of that avatar. No other avatar may act as a proxy or a representative for the banned avatar in order to continue the banned behavior. No builds, signage, or communications may be erected, or placed in Burn2 on behalf of a banned avatar. The posting of messages from a banned avatar is a continuation of the banned activity and is in violation of the ban."
-m2Danger

This decision was not made lightly. As a valued volunteer of Burn2, your contributions and involvement have been appreciated. However, several recent incidents have occurred that violate our community guidelines and standards, which are in place to ensure a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment for all members.

The specific reasons for this decision include:

Personal directed attacks posted publicly in Discord:
On 5/12/24, you engaged in posting public attacks on an individual in the Burn2 community Discord server community chat channel which is in direct violation of our Discord community’s code of conduct, which clearly states public personal attacks and inflammatory posts are not ok.

Discord Moderator warning issued:
On 5/13/24, you received a warning from Burn2’s Discord moderator, Freia, to be mindful of the CoC in reference to your post topics. Reposting inflammatory posts on behalf of a recently banned avatar and spamming server together with banned avatar’s ALTs is also in direct violation of our community’s code of conduct, which clearly states personal attacks and inflammatory posts are not ok.
Planning Meeting topic disruptions: On 5/19/24 Talia made multiple meeting topic requests to demand meeting focus of her choice which was the recent ban of DJ Puddles and to bring up an older ban on Shendara Destiny.

Disruption to Community Harmony:
Your actions have led to significant disruption and discomfort among other members of the Burn2 community. After previous warnings and attempts at resolution, the pattern of behavior persisted.

Our community’s guidelines are established to protect the well-being and harmony of all members. They are designed to foster an environment where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued. The decision to issue a permanent ban is a measure of last resort, taken only after all other avenues for resolution have been exhausted and/or unable to be resolved due to resource load.  
We understand that this may come as a disappointment to you, and we regret that it has come to this point. However, we must prioritize the collective well-being of our community. As of 5/22/24, your access to all community facilities, events, online platforms, and activities will be permanently revoked.

If you have any personal belongings within the Burn2 community SIM, they will be automatically returned to you unless earlier specified as a gift to the community.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this matter. Should you wish to discuss this decision further, please feel free to reach out in writing. While the ban is permanent, we are willing to listen to any feedback you may have and provide further explanation if needed.

Thank you for your attention to this serious matter.

Sincerely,
