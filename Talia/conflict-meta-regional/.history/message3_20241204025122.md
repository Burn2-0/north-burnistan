28th November I received a mail stating the following:
---
Talia, The issue with Burn2 is now in the hands of the Regional Network Team and is out of the purview of the meta-Conflict committee. Thank you for contacting
---
Which is weird because I didn't actually email the regional, or at least not recently. All these recent emails only went to conflict meta regional.
But a response is a response and not replying seemed rude... 

So...

Thank you, I am pretty sure It was the regional meta conflict committee I originally emailed about this....

I should also point out I just submitted a meeting agenda to what I believe is currently only going to iSkye And Leo pointing  out the SEO Nightmare I am causing for them as a regional and them personally by having publicly documented everything.  E.g. If you search for "Burn2" inside Second Life you find groups such as "Burn2 Bury This Complaint" or "Burn2 Justice for Puddle" or "Burn2 Reformists" Alongside all the regular search results.
Then for Leoandra Larsson and iSkye Silverweb if they were to google their usernames those both come up with front pages google results from North Burnistan and given what is on that page it makes them both pretty much untouchable in any future roles they may want to go for.

> Should probably note here that I made my usual mistake here, I was looking at my personal google results. I did actually check iSkyes search results in an incognito browser and Luckily for her I'd been lazy and had only mentioned her by first name on North Burnistan. I've since amended that for more Leo and iSkye. No keyword stuffing just replaced all the instances where I had said their names with their full names rather than just first names.

Please keep in mind that in my  original purposes of the Burn2 Org on Github:

* It had been exactly what you'd expect from the github repo. It was meant to be a repository of scripts for Burners of Second Life to make use of. The sole original purpose of it had been as a gift to the community.
* Shortly before the ban I'd realised that It would also serve as a place that people could suggest unformed ideas as at the time I was thinking that the reason for any agro being cause was that I had too many ideas that I tried to submit. Most of which were rather unpleasantly rebuked and left me feeling very much unwanted. So I additionally made it a place of free self-expression.

Then I was actually banned...

* At which point I added the North Burnistan Repo into the Org to hold all the documentation created to fight against what even then I saw as an unjust ban. North Burnistan was kinda a jokey banana republic state that like the freedom fighters of "Life of Brian" we were fighting against.

Since then:

* I've also added the "Burn2 Accord" Repo which has a copy of all the rules currently applicable at Burn2, and also was made as a place for the creation of new rules. i.e. It's got the draft of the By-Laws I wrote up after being told by the leader of the by-laws team that by-laws were the only way I would have my ban revoked... (I had wanted to see how long it would take to write up a set).. it also holds all the additional documentation I'd written up after the data breach that I knew from experience that Burn2 was missing in terms of Protecting itself from GDPR legislation.. So you could easily say I'd added on a venue for civic responsibility in the face of a perceived lack.

And "Yes" I have been keeping notes with regard to how Burning Man has been dealing with this situation. How a regional coordinator signed off on a Life Time Permanent Ban with No Appeals, with no notification, with no communication, with no attempt at any form of other punishment  between former core team, DPW lead and 007 ranger to lifetime ban, no appeals. In what for all intents and purposes looks to be a purely retaliatory  

Additionally I mostly have support from another burner group in Second Life called "Burn One". Burn One consists of mostly "Hardcore Burners" including numerous current leads and Numerous currently under bans of various levels. At a rough guestimate I would put the average age as a Burner in the Burn One group to approximately double that of the Burn2. Burn2 seems to operate on a policy of once "burnt" never to be reconsidered. When their numbers are down they never consider that it's something they might be doing wrong, instead they just look for new people. So the only long term burners left in Burn2 are those that are willing to keep their mouths shut when it comes to arguing against Leo and iSkye.

Burn2 as it is, is not a Burner group. They don't follow the principles, the rangers don't follow the handbook, There are those that try... But when push comes to shove any rangers that try to retain their morales get shoved... You just have to look at the recent exodus of rangers followed by a frantic employment drive prior to Octoburn. Or look at the reaction to the data breach... 335 volunteer and performer emails and usernames left out in public for 4 years. When notified The breach is barely fixed and when someone who was banned but in good faith wrote out the documentation they needed with no expectation of any favours due to that, wrote out 14k words worth of missing documentation, you know simple stuff like a privacy policy... That was just ignored.

I know Scotty got involved during the last "drama" That happened several years back with Herbie..since then it's (From what I've seen) been like walking on eggshells with anything that involves Herbie.. I've on several occasions offered to replace things that were placed by Herbie and that has always resulted in a hushed silence and a "Oh we don't talk about that..." vibe. I wasn't there so I can't make judgements on what actually occurred.. but the way people react. That stinks of people managing to bury something that they don't want resurfacing. It's almost like I am poking a group with a guilty conscience.  Question is, exactly how similar am I to Herbie? I wasn't there for the original Herbie incidents...  I've never spoken to him.. I don't "Think" I've actually done anything wrong.... I am seriously wandering exactly how much the truth was twisted back then considering how much I've seen it twisted in this case.

But one thing that you can't deny... Something very similar seems to have happened at least twice now. (Not including all the lesser bans of long time Burners between then and now.) And What are the common factors here? I wasn't even in SL for the Herbie Stuff... Herbie has not spoken a word regarding this current drama... So neither of us are common factors... Puddles who was lead last time is no longer a lead. and is likewise banned. Hell, It was Supersuz who was RC for Herbie was forced to stand down in favour of 3v, So even 3v is not a common factor... There are 2 maybe 3 that have retained the same roles with the powers to make what has happened back then, more recently with me... and will sure as sh!t happen again..... IF They can actually hold things together long enough for another drama filled cycle to happen again. And I can tell you now, My memories of Burning Life in 08/09 are some of my favourites of SL... I've had a lot of past memories trodden over recently. Those memories I am not going to bury so easily.

So do you want me to start collecting statements from those who have been banned, alienated or just left as Burn2 has "lost it's magic"? How many of those will it take?

Just to make it perfectly clear here I have a list of people to ask already.... It was me that found the data breach, When I was banned I was smart enough to make contact groups for all the members of all the Burn2 Groups I had access to.. When iSkye did her nod to notifying people of the data breach it was me that had the lists of those who were victims and also knew how many of that list actually got the notice sent out to all the Burn2 groups.. 17% of those people who had been enthusiastic enough about burn2 over 4 years still were in the groups to be notified... 83% of volunteers and performers over the last four years are NO LONGER INVOLVED with Burn2..

If that doesn't scream out that something is seriously FUBAR with Burn2
Then what about the  39% drop in overall traffic between 23 and 24...
And if that doesn't, can you explain all the different points I've made where rules, regulations and principles have been ignored... ?

TT

Ps. some form of reply would be appreciated...
