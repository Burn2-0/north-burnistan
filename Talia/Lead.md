# Yeah, I am PO with this sh!t

## Agenda points

Wow.... So.... Let me get this straight...  15 hrs ago now.. https://gyazo.com/44eff0c499796a46708773dbb624714a And now we have an overflow of things to discuss...? I would love for iSkye Silverweb to share a picture of the revision history of that sheet to show how many topics of discussion there was 16hrs ago... Go on dare you...

Currently I have a list of nearly 20 agenda points that either never made it to the list or were insufficiently dealt with.

## Responsibility

And "No." having 3v make a statement doesn't count as that..
Did 3v or BM act on their own in this?
Did they randomly pick one of the active leads to just randomly ban?
Orrrr have they been fed a pack of Lies... and then not investigated because they were under the assumption of trust.

## Jack Boots

I guess I don't need to say I won't be at that meeting unless This topic is the very first thing on that list..
iSkye Silverweb was online when I first started to write this message... I didn't get to "So.." . and she logged out...
I would like to hear the evidence that was presented to BM by the SECRET POLICE.....
I would like to KNOW WHO HAS JACK BOOTS IN THEIR CLOSETS.
They are operating without my consent... They are fabricating evidence... They are Wrongfully charging people with crimes that by their words hold the "Death Penalty"..  In a death penalty case it's not the accuser that wears the mask, The opposition needs to be accountable for taking another life...

Puddles and me have done what... ? Got step on enough times that we might have enough evidence collect up to give the jack boots trouble... ?? My task for today.... Has just become Install a local Ollama instance.. Train it on my entire chatlog.

`I would like to state that I am sorry for the Jack boots references. The vast majority of rangers are exactly what they are meant to be. Decent, Honorable, Wise people who I know I've hurt with the references here and else where. I can't excuse myself for making the reference beyond from the frame of reference at the time of writing it felt pretty close to the truth. Since then I've a great many of them acted exactly how I would hope a ranger would, rekindling my faith in the rangers and being able to direct blame at the few bad ones. <3 TT`


## Stats, Inclusivity and Marginalisation

What not so many people might not know.. just recently I took the publicly available available to all, meeting chat logs. I fed them to an Open AI GPT.. I then asked it a series of questions about those chatlogs. People say that GPT are just parrots.... or they have around that much intelligence.. Under that assumption it too that much intelligence to be able to see from just 10 meeting logs (it was from the meeting that Leo suggested the RIST team to the present.) That, it's word, I was being Marginalised.
The inclusivity of the Radical INCLUSIVITY survey team had been questioned 12 times.. 7 had been me.
The transparency of the RIST had come up 5 times.
I have worked in Lead Gen Marketing for 6years... It was literally my job to do what they are doing... Thanks to A/B split testing sometimes I would be doing 10-15 forms in a day. I dealt with GDPR and Privacy issues.. both the implementation of and trawling out DB for info requests. etc. etc.
I had talked to Leo Twice about my exclusion as the responsibility of that had been left at her feet I would have more but she was on holiday for 2 of the weeks. But both times I spoke with her she firstly denied that I volunteered. When I proved I had, She said I had done so too late.. Please feel free to check the meeting logs. I volunteer after Madog who was the first person to volunteer after a complaint was made about those who  were preselected. ( I will admit my enthusiasm is a long way from bubbling over but I do affirm I would do it.)
On the Sunday in which Puddles setup a discord link to a PRIVATE channel.. Which was objected about... and let to her exclusion from that meeting... I had made peace with the RIST lead.. I was rebuked for not going to her earlier.

So before I get into that reboke and it's meaning..

Leo I challenge you to find more examples where you have as a ranger been of assistance to me and I will bet you that I will be able to find at least 2 instances for each of yours where you have told me that "you can't do anything about that." I will also add that for each on you find I will also be able to find one instance where Aragon the AI (Unofficial) Ranger I trained myself has been of greater assistance. 
( Woo look at me with the radical self reliance there pretty sure it's not the intent of that but wtg 10p )

## More on Responsibility

That thursdays meeting Huntress had been complaining that people don't come to her to tell her things she needs to be a good lead. And i backed her up on this fact.  I guess everyone has heard that "A good leader leads by example.", So if people instinctively emulate their leaders because as a lead you should follow their example.. That example surely is that if people have stuff to tell me that is important to them they should come to me with it.. likewise if they have stuff that I need that is important to me then they should come to me.  

So basically the example being set is:
> As a lead I am going to sit around and do what I want, if you want me to do a good job then you have to come to me and if you don't the responsibility for my doing a bad job is on you.

Sorry, I am not a sedan chair bearer with the responsibility of making sure Leads get to their destinations of doing a good job.
You don't sign up to be a lead to make life easy on yourself.
It's the lead that takes responsibility.
If the lead needs to know something it's up to them to let it be know that they need to know it. A good lead that people want to follow would then be inundated with reports.
But we have a lead that is expecting people to psychically understand want they need, for them to prepare that and then deliver it to them and if that doesn't happen then the blame is left with the participants. Is that something worth Involving yourself with? I mean your damned if anything goes wrong at all.. so why bother do anything at all?
And the Lead of the Leads backed that up.

And just before I get onto our glorious leader another couple little side note...

## Ownership

So a little side project I've had, I brought this up at a meeting months ago. After I had had the usual SharkTank/Dragons Den back and forth (sorry if that one ended in nothing more than disinterest), I had suggested it would be a good idea to have a GitHub repo or something as it would be great for collaborative scripting projects and as a sweetener to the deal I figure I could compile a scripting library.
As per example I had left it with if any one was interested to get in contact with me. I typed out those word into actual text rather than rely upon peoples latent psychic abilities manifesting. Then I waited....
.
.
Last month, when I was getting particularly pissed with the inclusivity issue. Suddenly it was pointed out that there was going to be an official role for "Repo Wrangler". (I can't say I wasn't suspicious that this was just a "Hey Tal, Shiny thing." but it was something I could feel useful by doing and by doing it I could help the community and yeah, it would take my mind of the thought that the 10p were being manipulated .) So I started researching.. got a hold of a GitHub Organization under the name of Burn2-0, started kicking the tires on it.
To test something like that you really ned to actually get in there setup at least one of each thing you might want to use. So that is what I did. I got a few scripts off another burner and a few of my own, put together a base template to "brand" the scripts with, tried get community feed back on that, Went through each feature that an Org on github would provide.
All the while waiting for official sign off to go all out on the project, and by official sign off I mean I was watching for the Repo Wrangler position to popup so I could apply and I would have the back to actually push things further.
I showed the lead that had originally said about this and they kind of panic when they saw the other aspect of it that I had tested to know what they were about. Was told that they wouldn't support it if those features were part of the proposal.
Then I happened to run into another lead who would also have more use for this than most and under the assumption that this had been discussed amongst those I figured it would be good to show them what I had been up to.
I think the first comment was on the empty placeholder repo I had in there which included places to put the BurnBox script and another similar one. I was told off for not asking permission for creating an empty repo with a scripts name as it's title.
My choices in scripts was driven by 2 things mostly.
    1. Was it useful and something I made use of on a regular basis.
    2. Was it simple enough that they could actually have the double function of being educational for the average burner.
The verdict on them.. "Shit".
Was told off for making a personal repo under Burn2's name without permission.
Then was Lead-splained that they would show me how to do things properly.

The apology (to their credit) did come pretty quick after i had explained about the repo wrangler role, that it wasn't a personal repo but an Org that was a collection of repo that multiple users could make use of and most importantly it had transferable ownership.

The Comic irony here is that had I received a positive reaction there I would have attempted to present it or announce it at the planning meeting that was a few hours time. The ownership thing might have come up and that would have resulted in my not being able to get away with the North-Burnistan Repo.
((Personally I think it should remain as a cautionary tale and there are some quite amusing items in it. ))
