# Let's put it to a vote?

## Premise

So I've been going around talking to various people trying to establish if there was anyone at all that thought my ban was in any way fair or justified.
There has been no one that has even come close to answering in the affirmative on it. The very nearest anyone has come has been refusing to comment on the subject. Which given how not "this is not a decisions taking lightly." it's very difficult to attribute a refusal to talk about it to just not wanting to be one of the few to have gone as far as to say "Well you did go a little far...". Even if you were going to assume that a refusal to talk as being an affirmative. There is a handfull at most that would vote in that direction.

## How we got here

In a round about way what I am saying here is that if it went to a vote by the community of burners within Seconde Life, my ban would not have happened in the first place. Long and short of it is that I got banned for speaking out against two people. I did so in the defence of another. We were both trying to push for greater inclusivity. We were apparently too radicial for certain people.
We were pushing to make sure that a group of people were about to be included... Our main objectors were trying to force the responsibilty of ALL aspects of their saftey onto Burn2. Their self-reliance was 0% even when we tried to explain how they could better protect themselves the result would be just ignoring actual facts they were presented with and insisting on what I assume that they had been told was possible. There was even a couple occasssions when their mistress decided to speak up and in disbelief question things we were saying.
So ask yourselves what motivations did we have for arguing this point for several months? What on earth could be worth putting ourselves through a twice weekly barrage that just went around in circles? What could be worth doing that....? Thursdays meeting is at 5am for both of us so it's not like we just happened to be around for it.  
To play with Geeky toys and force people into their adoptance? Why? It's not like we are sponsored by discord... what is in it for us. 

There are two main reasons for us to have done that:
  1. That we knew how it worked as we had made the f'ing thing.. We knew what the risks were and knew that the positives far outweighed the negatives. (If you don't include the iresponsible, unfounded or imagined.) And yes we stood a chance to benefit in say being able to take part via phone from out beds or from work. 
  2. *RADICAL INCLUSION.* We had a _civic responsibilty_ to push for something that would enable _participation_ and _self-expression_. We didn't in our eyes have to panda to the paranoia and fearr that led to a total lack of _self-reliance_.

## My mistakes

So what did I initially do wrong? What were my mistakes?

 * I didn't drop everything else and silence a group of people to make another group happy.
 * I didn't just give up when I saw the 10p being abused.
 * I didn't have the self-reliance to attempt to try protect myself earlier from any form of retaliation.
 * I, again, didn't have the self-reliance to realise that I shouldn't trust the leads, and right up to receiving my ban, I was sure they would see sense.

 * *Obviously my biggest mistake was making the official complaint against those leads. I didn't think they would have the gall, when I had backed them into a corner like that, to actually ban me.*

 * I assumed that my prior service to Burning Life which although was only 2 events 13 years ago. If you were to scale but 2 up to that size that would be 6 years worth. I assumed that that would have meant I would have got more than 1 notecard with 4 points on it 2 of which became a problem on the very same notecard. 
     _(If that jumps out at you as being wrong, the same point has made it onto many international treaties on human rights, you can't make a law and convict someone of something that was not a crime at the time they commited it.)_
 * I assumed that had M2 have seen my name something might have made him remember what I'd done. 
    _(If you look around in here you can find a copy of my ban.. the quoted part from M2 doesn't read like it came from him as a message to me. It reads like it was just taken from something else and applied in this situation. I've asked many times for a chat with or something from M2 that addresses me directly by name.)_
 * I assumed that were I to step too far that the way rules were setup I woud ben able to talk with people. Certainly not 0 official notices to "Life Time Ban" in one notecard.
    _(Given that the official procdeure for a ban is to have one set of ranger FLAME the situation when they can't do anything more then it's handed to the RSCT who work with the original rangers to do what they can to FLAME the situation, if at that point nothing more can be done, THEN a pair of 007 are called in to FLAME the sitation and when they establish there is nothing more that can be done THEN that person is removed. It should be fairly obvious I am very familiar with how Rangers operate. I would like to think I could recognise a FLAME in action. I refuse to believe I completely missed one, let alone three. So in terms of mediation I saw nothing, explaination amounted to trying to explain that there was not enough rangers to do things properly and the notecard. So is it any wonder I feel hard done by and that my ban is complete bullshit? If someone was wrongly convicted for a crime and ended up in prison should they not fight the conviction? What sort of precident does it set if I just crawl under the carpet and tuck myself in? Am I doing the next person who falls into the bad graces of Leo and iSkye any favours by doing so? )_

## So what now?

So where are we with all this? What would happen if there was a _communal effort_ for a little democracy? If there was a Vote from the community with regard to the decisions being made under their names?
As I say NO-ONE answered my question in the positive. The majority just flatout said it was a terrible mistake and it shoudl be reversed. A good few people, more than the silents went forther than that. Hell, I've even asked both Leo and iSkye that same question. NO ONE, without excception, has actually been able to tell me that they think I should have had that ban and that that ban was conducted in a legitimate manner.
This, Again, SHows how neither Leo or iSkye seem to understand what it means to be a ranger. They don't seem to get that if they had followed basic ranger guidelines, they would not be in the situation they are. Why have I not just given up? Because I know damn well that were rules and procedures followed, I would not have been banned. The fact that they are trying their utmost to ignore me, trying to wish me out of their lives just shows how deluded they have let themselves become.
Not made a Analogy so far. So how about this... 
> You twist your ankle, hurts a lot, best course of action? 
_I don't think that amputation and then attempting to walk on the imagined ghost foot would be many peoples first answer.._
That is how far from make even common sense let along following the rules that Leo and iSkye have strayed.

## Assumptions
I know in the my mistakes section I made a lot of assumptions... Personally I think the word carrys bad conotations, when I say "assumption" I bet your mind instantly jumps to "Oh, they are bad, shouldn't do that, you know what they say, 'assumptions are the mother of ..." etc.
An assumption is just filling in the blanks in a siuation where you do not have all the facts at your disposal. Operating under what to the best of your knowledge is how things are. So to reframe my assumptions:
My "assumptions" were all based on things like:
 * I *presumed* that knowing the ranger hand book better than most, I had a grasp on what they should and shouldn't do.
 * I *believed* that people held the 10p in the same regard as I do.
 * I *expected* that a certain level of human decensy would be adhered to. 
 * I *trusted* that Leads would work to the same standards I would. 
 * I *hoped* that Common Sense and Common Courtesy might be things that would mean something.


## Their mistakes

Communication is the biggest one here. Leaving me to make assumptions.
So everything on this list will involved a certain amount of supersition...

### A ban is the "ultimate" solution note

This is the dumbest idea, even were it handled correctly. When I say "Ultimate" I mean like it's being assumed to be right now. Unortunately this is not something I need to make assumptions on. I got a notecard from Leo... She took my original Ban letter and tacked on a paragraph at the top.

> Hi, Talia,
> I, once again, get to be the harbinger of some explanations for you. I find it sad that you do not have other things to do than troll Burn2. You, and your alts, are banned from Burn2. That means you cannot access the regions or participate in meetings, communications, events, or other activities. Incident Reports, suggestions, voting, etc. from banned individuals and their alts, as always, will be ignored. As I have said before, I have run out of energy and the willingness to reason with you. I will not discuss any further. I am sorry that this was not more clearly and explicitly explained for you.
> Leo

Let's break this down in the nice and condescendign way it was written. I wasn't aware that condescension was something that Rangers had in their kits. [Maybe Leo is just adding that herself](https://gyazo.com/7b5e2fcdad19d113c60b19c1bcf6ae0a)
 * "I find it sat that you do not have other things to do..." Assumption right there... Not quite sure how on one hand I know that two leads in particular are doing their level best to ignore me. And then taking the fact that they are ignoring me as best they can and turning that into "you are pitiful becuase you don't have anything else in your life..." Sorry, Leo, you can't have your cake and eat it here. You don't get to pick what you are willing to know about me and then force that reality on me. That is wrong in so many ways.
 * "You, and your alts, are banned from Burn2." Again you are wrong. You were even nice enough to post my first reference along with this message:
> "When a ban is placed on an avatar, it is a result of the behavior of that avatar. No other avatar may act as a proxy or a representative for the banned avatar in order to continue the banned behavior. No builds, signage, or communications may be erected, or placed in Burn2 on behalf of a banned avatar. The posting of messages from a banned avatar is a continuation of the banned activity and is in violation of the ban."
> -m2Danger
  I hope you note that the wording in that references "Avatar". So the "Avatar" Talia Tokugawa is what was banned. M2, I presume, Seems to have a better grasp of the Community Standards of Second Life. In which you should probably brush up on the section on disclosure. By which I mean that linking one avatar to another as a Alt and by acting upon that information is a presumption of identity. By acting upon that you are disclosing personal information by your actions. So please do attempt to ban all my alts.
 * "Run out of energy.." - Do you really want me to run the statiscal analysis as to how much effort you've expended on my behalf? And then excatly how much of that was in anyway of help to me? You told me that you had recused yourself from the Puddles thing before I was even aware it was a thing. Please explain to me where I have come to you with an issue and you've given me anything more than "You gotta deal with it". 
 * "I will not discuss.." - You really are trying so hard to bury me alive aren't you? You know damn well that this is not going away. What happens if you leave this unsresolved? What does that get you? What does that do for burn2? What does that do for the community? I am the one who is trying to communicate here. 
    Amusing side note... I just did a server of the word "ignore" in the ranger manual. 3 results.. 
  1. From pg 10 on the subject of Social Capital, The first actual content in the manual to my mind.
> When Rangers are perceived as authoritarian, uptight, entitled, unprofessional, or incompetent (i.e., withdrawing social capital), we will be *ignore*d or resisted.
    Seems quite fitting... I am resisting your decisions and I am fairly sure I've used some of those terms about this whole situation... Once or twice.
  2. Not really pertinent, was about not making a comment about an ugly sweater for a gift.. pg 30 if you want to confirm.
  3. This.... This is just perfect.... 
> *Hard Conversations*
> _Adapted from content by Shir Nir and Lauren Zander, Handel Group_
> Good communication is what makes an organization work and in most organizations is insufficient. Most of us don’t communicate the most important things and *don’t deal with hard conversations*. We choose to gossip or *ignore* or *sweep things under the carpet*. We get *irritated and upset with people* and that leads to a _decrease in relationships, communication, and an ability to collaborate, be happy and produce results_. We make *excuses and justifications* that it will not make a difference and tell ourselves that we can deal with it or that *it will go away*, but *it never does and never works*. At some point we may *explode or leave*, simply because *we didn’t deal with the real problems*. Since _effective communication and relationships are the most important aspect of an organization_, we have created a process to give people a way to have hard conversations.
    So, remember the numerous times I've refused to let things go? How I push so hard to try reach amicable solutions rather than just "Sweep things under the carpet." My profile right this moment has had an entire pick devoted to not letting things go. As I've said many times Burning Life was formative for me. During that time I was acting as what is now known as a 007 i.e. I was responsible for pressing the button on the bans. I wasn't a ranger, But I had to absorb the rules of the rangers along with tos/cs/pp etc.  As it was a joint event between BM and LL I don't think were I to have been a ranger I would have been allowed to be in that postion. But I do believe in the rangers rules I took them on board and they've been there ever since. The majority of the time when I get upset by something even if I can't explain it in the moment it's when something I consider a rule is gone against. Later on I usully remember why it was i was getting upset. But you should probably be aware of that. If I am getting upset it's usually for that reason. That a rule has been bent or broken and part of the upset it that I know it's wrong  part is that I can't instantly put my finger on why. This is not to say I am always right about stuff. Just from expereince if I am getting upset I do have good reasons for it.
 * Then finally, an apology that it was not explained more clearly or explicitly. So an admission of wrong doing in the process that ended up with my getting banned. You know... If these were legal procdeeding that would be an admission of professional negligence?

### You are just a troll...

They assume that I am trolling them. As I said to one of the other leads last night. There is one thing and one thing alone that I have actively intended to hurt in all this. 
That one thing is the Pride of Leo and iSkye. But then If I were to get a brick and throw it in the opposite direction to them there is still a good chance I would hurt said pride. Not often you see people with pride to such extreme that it's developed it's own gravity.
They seem to also assume that what I am doing is not my trying to make light of what is a quite serious situation. If I got serious I would not be making so much noise. In fact for all intents and purposes I would seemingly disappear, I am specifically being noisy right now... Which to be fair is my assuming they would understand what it would mean if I went dark on them.
So to reiterate, I do not want to be "swept under the carpet", All I have done is stand for things I believe are correct. As Leo's not quite nicely shows. I seem to have a better grasp of what it means to be a ranger  than she does. 
Oh and if necessary I can bring up countless examples of where I've tried to stand up for something I know is either 10p, ranger rules or just something good for the community and more often than not I receive a dragging over the coals for it.
But one thing you can be certain of... if I do go dark. If I give up trying to communicate that is when you should worry.
A threat? No a warning... Push anyone enough and they will "At some point we may *explode or leave*", Doing what I do I am always making things and stuff just to see how I would best make something that is on the darker side of the hats.This is mostly just so I can work out the mindset of the blackhat and how best to counter it. So to quote the main pages of the rangers...
> "...providers of reliable information, facilitators of public safety, and navigators of the edge of chaos."
I do not want to be pushed to a point where I start noticing a darkening of my hat so to speak. If I become an actual troll... with intent to actually do damage Burn2 are in no place to stop me. Last time I was trying to advise about security lookat want I went through to try protect people.
That in itself represents the biggest single threat you have to your secruity... The paranoia and fear that lead to the enable fear and mistrust build up in two people that maybe are not the most socially adept but they sure as hell know what they are talking about in certain areas.  From my point of view it really looked like that was week after week being cultivated and tended to. That a small group of people were picked to champion it who were given, More becuase of their alignedment on an issue. 

### Okay, SO if not trolling then what?

Well, Take a look at What I have done... If you have a negative look to the event imediately preceeding it and use that as context. 
I did the last Effigy Burn. Did I just heap a stack of palletes up or was I trying to weave a message into it? Or several messaegs. Firstly, I wouldn't light it until a certain number of people came up and helped. You know "Communal Effort", "Participation" but I wasn't going to be so mean as to have you work for it so I had deicided the that narative of dancing around the base with fire seemed apt. Let people self-express a little. I had even tried to prepare fire toys to be given away for people, "Gifting". There was meant to be so much more. But this was all set against a backdrop of the almost seemed to be setup argument which was eventually the main reason given for Puddles' ban so my mind got dragged to places I didn't want it to be when I was trying to create something to foster community spirit and bringing people together.
Maybe I should explain how many times I neerly lost it during that burn... THe intro was supposed to be relatively simple it just required for the lamplighter fire dancers to show a bit of "imediacy" for things to have started how I had envisined.. All they needed to do was to not sit down... instead to becon people in the audience to come just them... that and hand out firetoys... that was it. Not a big asked... I ideally wanted to have be invovled as little as possible. I wanted to focus to be on the community not one member of the commmunity. Kind of diluted the ideal. So on the fly I had to reveal myself... and totally unprepared stand up in front of every (first time I nearly walked) and come up with a story as to why people needed to come up to do stuff... You could say I was pretty much peaking on andrenadaline at that point, But hey Immediacy/self expression. I finally got through after what seemed like an entirnety and was met with..... nothing. And that would be the second time I nearly actually there was only those two really.. But this one I enough time to actually question a lot of things about why I was bothering.
I was quite litterally moving my hand to press clt-shft-H when Catori saved the Burn, she picked pretty much the perfect moment to put the tunes on adn come stand by me.. slowly but surely people followed.. From that point onwards everything went in a bit of a blur. I had assumed that less handholding would be required, so I had been a little over loaded between live coding some of the effects, debugging others and trying to keep up the nararative. But a lot of people came up and said how much they liked it when it was over. Just imagine had it gone corectly. 
I guess my aspirations were set a little high on that one. There was meant to be two other significant components to it... 

 * There was meant to be musical instruments. I've done musical stuff for sl in the past including a rather conplex sampler. For the event I had planned to make a junk orchestra.. besides a load of oil and water drum ... drums. I had done a big old industrial slapophone (blue man group) and this huge stand up bass that was made out of an oil drum welded to I-beams wth a pool ladder welded to one end with steel cables as strings. That should have been the initial sound track. Oh and I have the details on the Lamp Lighters drum set so my intent was to make them so you could mix and match and they would sync. Obviously this was intended to be another nod to communal effort and more obviously self expression and participation.  If you have not tried musical instruments in sl like that basically it's like jazz, each instrument has multiple loops in it and the person that is playing that instrucment has control over what to play.
 * There was also a 64 person dance ring.. By that I mean rather than what happened there was to be a ring of "seats" all of when contained dances to pick from.. without giving too much away there was also a whole gamification thing built in... Every person on the ring had "some" control over the ring. THat was again communal effort... but also just some good fun and the joy of discoverey trying to work out what weird shanigans I'd coded into something like that.  I guess it goes without saying that I was trying to put across a mesage with it and the hope was that when someone discovered something they would share that knowledge... and that dopamine hit from having progressed the puzzle woudl drive everyone to try work it out and that whilst there was individeual "Games" .... Spoilers, Lets just say it had it's layers.

So given that was at most a couple months prior to my ban, wtf?

Yeah I invented and entire bannana republic country just as a medium to carry messages... That came off the back of an offhand comment I had made in reference to the man freedom fighter groups in Monty Python's Life of Brian. But the isssue there was thhe closer it seemed to be like what was happened the more reason people would have to be annoyed/offended by it.
So the moment I receieved my ban... I was in my pool, we had friends over so all of a suddenrecieved that note..I was offhandedly playing with "Bungo". When it was decided to shut down complaints, I took that and another offhand comment from someone else. Who'd said there should be a bad leader bingo game. So I had made it. Initially I had done it just for the Lulz... But it very quickly dawn on my that if someone were playing it then they obviously had complaints and so I was in the process of making a "hidden" complaints system whereby if someone was playing Bungo they would be able to use that system to record what had actually happeed. Given that when I had issue a couple complaints, rather than let them get a fair look, they were buried. Now, how do you bury something like that? Well, First you shutdown complaints. Then your tell rangers not to address it. And then you rush through a ban against the person who made the complaints.
If my ban note had an ounce of honesty to it it would ammount to "You had the audancity to actually file a complinant against the leads." But they can't say that becuase that would validate the original complaint. That would mean they might face some form of investigation. That would mean if someone where to ask me I might actually start saying about some of the stuff that thtey have done that goes directly again the rules of the rangers and is often very questionable when held up against the 10p..  
Interesting Side note. If you look through the declaration of independance you sevearal aspects are covered... but it doesn't amatter where I look at the rules and laws I have always been able to fund equivalences   

## Conclusion

Firstly, If things had been done correctly then why am I still questioning stuff as it in theory would have been properly explained three times over. But as the first time I got close to speaking my side of thigns wasn't till months after the ban via an alt account, and litterally the dayu after that happeend that Account got banned. Can anyone in their right minds say that I have had a fair hearing in this? 

* Unless you can say "Yes!" 
* Then go onto explain to me:
  - The reasons for:
    - The bent rules.
    - The broken/ignored rules.
    - When I point out I am not named by M2 in my ban, people go very quiet.
  - Why complaints made by someone can be made to vanish by banning the complainer.
    _(SO SO OPEN TO ABUSE!)_
  - How in such a free and open community a decision can be made that is:
    - The exact oppostite to one of the principles that community stands by.
    - Universally disagreed with.
    - Conducted without adhereance to the rules.
    - I would assume the primary source of information to the decision maker was one of the 2 people complained about.
    - I assume made unilaterally by 1 or 2 leads? 
      _(I really should ask some of the other leads who don't thing I should have been banned. Fairly certain that leads are supposed to gain consensus on decisisons.. or at least a majority)_
    - That has caused both leads and rangers to question their place at Burn2.
  - How can the leads involved in this be so dense that they do not realise...
    - This is their mistake not mine.
    - That they can't make this go away by ignoreing it and hoping.
    - The harm they are causing by doing this.
    - That they should reread the ranger rule book as it all covered in the publicly available ranger handbook. 
      _(( As you both seem to have forgotten here is the [link for it](https://rangers.burningman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ranger-Manual-2024.pdf). Enjoy, It's a worthy read. ))_
    - That I am not going away just becuase they say "Because I said so.."
    - That the only way I will give up is by getting answers to all of the above and more...
    - That that more... grows the longer that they try ignore me and try sweep things under the carpet.
    - That the level of shit they are going to be in if as suggest here they had me banned purely to get out of having complaints raised against them... That doesn't get less. Because I won't let people sweep me under the carpet.
      _(( Call that me doing you a favour and making you accountable for your actions. ))_
    - That were they to:
      - Come clean, publicly.
      - Revoke my ban.
      - Revoke puddles ban.
      - iSkye stick to Comms lead and relinquish her "Leadership" of everything she purveys.
      - Leo to submit herself to a full independant investigation by two randomly selected playa ranngers. For them to decide if she should lead rangers & be a ranger.
      - Leo to for herself look at why she is a ranger.
      - Leo to look at if being lead of the rangers is more important to her than being a ranger.
      - Leo If you were demoted to Alpha ranger right now. Is you pride going to prevent you from working your way back up again? Would you willing do that as proof that you are not in this as a power hungry control freak?
    
NB* this list is just off the top of my head the actual list of issues is most likely going to be much longer if as i am sure won't happen either Leo or iSkye see sense.

But.. given all the above then Why exacctly would I be willing to adhere to what I see as an unjust ban. Oh.. anohter option... have m2 come inworld and explain it all to me personally.
Is that not a fair compromsie?
As you know with me... I note down everything I can. So as time goes on this these lists just get bigger. So my advice.. FOLLOW THE RANGER HANDBOOK!  You are no where near being able to transcend the model and the fact that you are having trouble finding people to fill a free event... Surely must proof that. 





* That doesn't give someone who was justifiably banned to chance to change and redeem themselves. 
 * It doesn't give someone who was unjustly banned the ability to fight abgainst it.  



They assume that I am trolling them. As I said to one of the other leads last night. There is one thing and one thing alone that I have actively intended to hurt in all this. 
That one thing is the Pride of Leo and iSkye. But then If I were to get a brick and throw it in the opposite direction to them there is still a good chance I would hurt said pride. Not often you see people with pride to such extreme that it's developed it's own gravity.
They seem to also assume that what I am doing is not my trying to make light of what is a quite serious situation. If I got serious I would not be making so much noise. In fact for all intents and purposes I would seemingly disappear, I am specifically being noisy right now... Which to be fair is my assuming they would understand what it would mean if I went dark on them.
Of couurse they might have assumed that I would give up eventually... 
And now that it's become obvious that they can't just knock up a flimsy at best ban rush it past m2 and hope he doesn't question it too much and then have it issued, then finally sweep me under the nearest rug to a round of congratulatory group hugs and patting each others back... 
It REALLY is the last thing they actually want to do.

Burn2 being the successor of Burning Life holds a certain standard for me. Leo especially should know that even during SL21B I was still trying to have Linden Lab do something with regard to my rejection from mentors. That was (to the best of my knowledge) due to my actions at SL20B in which I've got an entire year chasing them on that reason, Spoken with a good proportion of the exectives of LL, Filled not 1 but 2 Abuse reports against myself, and a good number of other things which all seem quite unreasonable, all do to my not geting an answer to what in my mind is a perfectly reasonable question. Why was I rejected from a voluntary possible for which on paper I would put money of my being within the top handful of applicants they recieved, and then after not being picked how could a group supposed to be mentors take the position that leaving me in the dark as to what that issue was be "The Mentor" way to go on that?

I mean if I wanted do push things that far. Both Leo and iSkye have made mistakes that by the ranger rules would have them removed. Not just from being leads but from rangers entirely.  


PS. I talk a lot about My Mistakes and how this has affected me.. before anyone tries to suggest IO am being self-centered. I am speaking things I know to be true. I think Puddles would probably agree wiht everthing I say and she was certainly there for a lot of this but I am not going to put words into her mouth. If you want them there are elsewhere in this repo.
