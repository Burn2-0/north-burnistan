# September Update
So, I've not been attending meetings.. Please don't think that means I am giving up on this. Just means I am operating  behind the scenes more.
So tonight for example..
Having posted that agenda point earlier in the week, I pretty much knew that it would be buried. Which is exactly why I record everything I do.


[![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/c353f0f2907e5da2fbda141152bf194d.gif)](https://gyazo.com/c353f0f2907e5da2fbda141152bf194d)

Then if I am online for a meeting with the contact groups I made from the groups before you had a chance to ban me it's very easy to get a fairly good idea of who is actually at the meeting.

 * Laurelle Nightfire
 * Barbs Kurka
 * Cuga Rajal
 * Huntress Catteneo
 * iSkye Silverweb
 * Magic2life Resident
 * Shiny Starchild
 * GinHama Resident
 * XiledSol Resident
 * Qee Nishi
 * BeekeeperWes Resident
 * ThomasRaowulf Resident
 * LilyVonSchtupp Resident
 * KittySparrows Resident
 * Freia Guillaume
 * MirandaNomad Resident
 
 How many people on that list do you think I've notified about the missing agenda point?
 
 Whilst I think what has happened is wrong... I will continue to fight it.
 
 I'm reposting the original ban because people keep getting surprised as to how extreme a first action this was. I've corrected two misconceptions as to how long the ban was tonight . Both of them thought the ban was measured in months and therefore my annoyance was wayyyy out of proportion. When I shared my actual ban notice.. There was a much greater understanding.

### The Personal attacks? 
There are two possibilities. 

--- 

It was either when I likened what was going on to fascism, pasted the dictionary definition and provided examples for the majority of the points. 

**OR**

It was my recounting a particularly  triggering situation for which I tried goto rangers for help with.

### Posting for Banned Avatar:

> On 5/13/24, you received a warning from Burn2’s Discord moderator, Freia, to be mindful of the CoC in reference to your post topics. Reposting inflammatory posts on behalf of a recently banned avatar and spamming server together with banned avatar’s ALTs is also in direct violation of our community’s code of conduct, which clearly states personal attacks and inflammatory posts are not ok.


 * Okay, That was not considered a warning be either of us. 
 * Fair, I was posting inflammatory posts in public. 
 * Read the next paragraph and ask yourself "Why?". 
    - As it says, I posted inflammatory posts on behalf of a recently banned avatar.
    - That avatar had made certain incident reports against the same people that I would have to to follow CoC.       
    - I was trying to resist doing this... https://gyazo.com/56c36121f19ffe9e542ed2b8db1efd30
    - I got a single notecard in response to say my complaints would be looked into.
    - Please Check the Date of my Ban.
    - Is it reasonable to consider that I was put in a place where I thought that the rules wouldn't be followed and I was in fear of following proper procedure?
    
 ---
 
 * Also please note that the only reference to Alts came in the very notecard that quoted it as an issue. In a legal situation.. That is known as "ex posto facto".
 
 The principles cited in international human rights standards and various legal documents emphasize:

- US Constitution Article 1 Section 9-10: Prohibits ex post facto laws at the federal and state levels, reinforcing the importance of fairness in rule application.
- European Convention of Human Rights Article 7: Ensures no one is punished under a law that wasn’t established at the time of the action.
- International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Article 15(1): Prohibits retroactive criminal charges, ensuring fairness and predictability.
- American Convention on Human Rights Article 9**: Similarly prohibits ex post facto laws, emphasizing the ethical need for clarity and fairness in law enforcement.

### Planning Meeting Disruption:

> Planning Meeting topic disruptions: On 5/19/24 Talia made multiple meeting topic requests to demand meeting focus of her choice which was the recent ban of DJ Puddles and to bring up an older ban on Shendara Destiny.

No mention of Shen. My "Demands" were because I was consistently being ignored, and I had been rationed to a single agenda point per week. I didn't bring up any more than I had been rationed to and then had had ignored.

> [2024/05/19 09:07]  Talia Tokugawa: I would like to add my want for the agenda point about needing more info about puddles ban that was truncated at the end of last weeks meeting resumed.. And I would like my agenda Point that I had submitted for thursdays meeting that besides the automated response has not been acknowledged... That was Triage Survey... which I realised earlier today was the FL from FLAME. And I'd quite like to know why my agenda point submitted for today has not been acknowledged... That one was asking plan and simple if there was actually any point in my trying to submit them...  And that is my not bringing up the other agenda point not of my submission which I am fairly certain is definitely the least pleasant on that sits there ignored in the pool of unwanted agenda points.  Oh and Poll.
> ...
> Talia Tokugawa: I can add more if you want... but that is just the ones I've had missed for my ration of one per meet
> ...
> [2024/05/19 09:08]  Leondra Larsson: so your topic is a triage survey, Tallia?
> [2024/05/19 09:09]  Talia Tokugawa: No.. My TOPICS... More info about puddles.. cut short last sunday
> [2024/05/19 09:09]  Talia Tokugawa: then triage survey the topic ignored for thursday
> [2024/05/19 09:09]  Leondra Larsson: more about Puddles? then?
> [2024/05/19 09:09]  Leondra Larsson: ok
> ...
> [2024/05/19 09:09]  Talia Tokugawa: then todays topic is should I even bother attempting to add agenda points when they get ignored... 

--- 

*((Amusing aside... heh... I realised later that my "triage survey" was pretty much the first step in a F(ind out)lam. When I say I believe in the ranger ways I seriously mean it. I maybe label things different but underneath it all  ;) ))*

### Disruption to Community Harmony: 
> Your actions have led to significant disruption and discomfort among other members of the Burn2 community. After previous warnings and attempts at resolution, the pattern of behavior persisted.

---

Oh right, cause this has not happened before.... 
 As the saying goes, Takes two to Tango...
  And I think you'll find I was no where near the playa during any of the previous incidents/bans.
    If the same thing keeps happening to you over and over maybe it's not them that is the problem.
      Maybe.. just Maybe... It's you that is the problem.

---

I would like to reference a couple of things at this point.
On the Burn2 Ranger page [https://www.burn2.org/policies/burn2-rangers-manual/]
In the suggested reading section right at the end.
The Impact of Toxic Influencers on Communities (16 minute read) - [https://intenseminimalism.com/2020/the-impact-of-toxic-influencers-on-communities/]

> "**Polarization** — this is probably the most dangerous. This person will make sure that people, especially new people, are inoculated with the idea that there’s a good group (the one led by them) and a bad group (everyone else)."

> "**Passive Aggression** — everything they don’t like, gets a negative note from them, sometimes even taking things happening in one discussion, and mocking them in another, in a way that only the two people involved will likely notice, and everyone else… will just see one annoyed person snapping back seemingly for no reason."

> "**Swarming** — they reply every (or most) of the discussions. They are there, they feel everywhere, so people start being on alert about getting an answer from them."

> "**Repetition** — issues are constantly brought up, even if they seemed settled in the past. Sometimes they might even take some time to prepare the ground, get people to agree with them first telling their part of the story, before raising it again, so they have reinforcements ready. There’s no closed case for them, until they get it their way."

> "This is often the cycle:
> 
> A new person comes in.
> They notice the abuse.
> They try to do something.
> The clique protects the abuser.
> Everyone else is too tired to support, so they stay silent.
> The new person, unsupported, retreats."

I am well aware that I keep bringing the same thing up over and over. The reason for that is that I actually strongly believe in quite a few (most) parts of the rangers guidelines. In particular from Page 33 of the official BRC Rangers handbook.

> "Good communication is what makes an organization work and in most
> organizations is insufficient. Most of us don’t communicate the most important
> things and don’t deal with hard conversations. We choose to gossip or ignore
> or sweep things under the carpet. We get irritated and upset with people and
> that leads to a decrease in relationships, communication, and an ability to
> collaborate, be happy and produce results. We make excuses and
> justifications that it will not make a difference and tell ourselves that we can
> deal with it or that it will go away, but it never does and never works. At some
> point we may explode or leave, simply because we didn’t deal with the real
> problems. Since effective communication and relationships are the most
> important aspect of an organization, we have created a process to give people
> a way to have hard conversations."

Page 33 Ranger Manual
[https://rangers.burningman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ranger-Manual-2024.pdf]

Maybe writing up essay length notecard is not everyone's idea of good communication. BUT.. I am trying to communicate. I have stuck to my guns with regard to Not burying things. I have a profile pick that pretty much says that.
* I have had my communications rationed (agenda points in meetings).
* I have been marginalised.
* I've been ignored. (agenda points in meetings + lead policy on ignoring me)
* I have tried to retain belief in what I know are good solid rules and guidelines. Trying to call those who should be paragon to those guidelines to account when they flagrantly ignore them for their perceived positions of power. 
* When I followed the CoC and finally issued an official complaint I had 1 notecard to confirm receipt.
    - 4 days later I received a Life Time Ban.
    - No official warning.
    - No FLAME.
    - No suspension.
    - Straight to the highest possible punishment possible (without alerting external authorities). 

It's *"appreciated it's a disappointment"* but it's also assumed that *"your understanding and cooperation in this matter"* is a given and then finally *"we are willing to listen to any feedback you may have and provide further explanation if needed."*. 
There has been an active policy to ignore me, people are recommended to abuse report and block me. 

* One of the things I've tried in order to have this situation explained to me in the face of "Willing to listen" was spending numerous hours pretending to be a ranger instructor who had been promised by 
certain leads that they were willing to learn and wouldn't interrupt me.That Led to the 8000 word notecard which by slowly distributing it to the community I managed to open communication with those.

* The very public RIST Survey : 
    "I find the incessant attacks on 'certain' members appaling. The constant disregard and shutdown of ideas and helpful projects with heavy bias is also appalling. I have been in at least 4 meetings to see these actions on NON-Inclusiveness and dictatorship has prevailed. I once was smitten by burn2. I had a very very special burn in Octoberburn that was very personal to me, now that is tainted. If management does not resign or CHANGE their dictatorship, I believe this community will fail and the sim will go bye bye. For a group of adults to behave this way would make me give a warning to change or i'd pull the plug on the entire operation, seriously. I may be a new burner and not that versed in all the ins and outs, but that doesn't exclude me from feeling what i feel based on what I have witnessed 1st hand." ((I don't know who wrote this so I can't attribute it.))
  This is quite literally an accusation of bullying and harassment Is there an associated LSD (Location,Situation, Determination).
* I made similar accusations numerous times.
* I also have openly talked on the subject of depression and suicide.
* I've also gotten myself into states of serious psychiatric distress.
* I've talked about feeling like I am loosing control and will end up griefing Burn2. (I was seriously offering to give rangers training in dealing with me because they are woefully unprepared, I even made a fairly sneaky griefing device to show some Rangers.
* I would say the violent ejection of me could be considered an assault as it was certainly non-consensual.
* I have been told directly that an important ranger recommends  my muting and AR'ing. 

Reason I bring up this list. These are all items that are "Must Report". A ranger that comes across any of these things needs to kick it up the chain of command.  I am fairly sure as the vast majority have not been looked into that these all got the ranger lead who determined not worth it.. The official ranger handbook determines "Must Reports" as so serious that the penalty for not filing is their removal from rangers. 

Code of Conduct... More things that are removing from rangers level issues. 
* Losing self-control.
* Misusing your special role or role abilities by throwing your weight around.
* Making demands or making threats and acting unprofessionally.
* Resorting to acts of humiliation or intimidation or taunting or mocking others.
* Abusing the community’s trust.
(I can provide numerous examples on all of these)

* Terms of Service and Community Standards violations found to be true. (Can be seen in the minutes of planning meetings. Ranger Lead broke SL Community standard with disclosure.)
* Assault or any other acts of violence. (My ban and then my treatment after.)
* Knowingly neglecting a big problem. Alert others if you can’t deal with it! Yes, just kick it sideways. (I literally spent Hours in peoples IM educating them as to the way rangers should behave. The policy to ignore me was "Knowing Neglect" The problem was that I was right about what I was saying and therefore un-reportable. 

* Oh there is this as well... [![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/6f6251de3cf50e56a84f37351a2ccc50.jpg)](https://gyazo.com/6f6251de3cf50e56a84f37351a2ccc50) [https://gyazo.com/6f6251de3cf50e56a84f37351a2ccc50]

### However...
...Beyond everything else. The ranger rules and guidelines are in place for very good reasons. The only reason this whole situation has blown up the way it has is because the current Ranger lead thinks that those rules do not apply to her. The fact that she is ignoring those rules and making things up as she goes along is exactly what has enabled me to continue this as long as it has gone on. Problem for her is that I am in the right. This is why I got banned straight away. This is why I was told not to discuss this. If there was a legitimate reason for my ban I would accept it. 
The ranger lead, The person who should exemplify everything that it means to be a Burner break the basic principles of being a burner. She leads purely on the fear she creates by banning people that speak out against her. 
If this were not the case why is she so scared of me. She would be able to publicly debate with me, without going silent and then runnning away. She would do what rangers do... She would communicate.

I am going to file another complaint once I have finished this. This is to be the actual complaint as there is a limit on the number of characters I can add to an official complaint. 
I do not see my ban as legitmate, I see myself as an illegitmately excluded Burner. 

### Appeal...
In law there are 4 situations where no right to appeal is justifiable. 
* Plea Bargains: If someone accepts a plea bargain in a criminal case, they often waive their right to appeal as part of the agreement.
* Certain Immigration Decisions: Some immigration decisions, such as expedited removal orders, do not provide the right to appeal1.
* Not Guilty Verdicts: In criminal cases, the prosecution cannot appeal a “not guilty” verdict due to the principle of double jeopardy2.
* Frivolous Appeals: Courts can dismiss appeals deemed frivolous or without merit, effectively denying the right to appeal.

The only one of the above that might apply in my case is "Frivolous Appeals". How exactly can my every single appeal I have attempted have been frivalous. 

So this is my complaint... My ban was conducted by someone who should by the rules of the rangers and burners have been removed from her position, for each of the things I was accussed of I can present 3-4 points that she should be removed for. 
If she is certain of her position in this. Then have her recuss herself and let this complaint run through the actual process for a complaint. 
However what is far more likely is that she is going to continue to try ignore me, remember "Knowngly neglecting a big problem..." If this complaint is ignored... That in itself is reason to have her removed.

The thing that everyone should keep in mind. Rangers operate purely on social capital. I.e. they are given their power by the participants. The current Ranger lead is running the social credit account into the red.
