# Burner Spirit...

I had a conversation with a former lead/ranger, They were asking about my "history of being a burner"... 

I also had another conversation with a different ranger, who said I should "Let it go...". That I should look elsewhere for things in SL. I won't rehash my usual rant about "Let it go.". Beyond the fact that usually when someone says it they they don't often know what it is that they are asking.

So two fairly good reasons to write this....

---

I did 2 years at Burning Life... 2008 and 2009.
   - I was DPW Lead.
   - I was Core team.
   - I was (as it's currently defined) 007.
That's it... My total Burning Man experience.

---

However... I do have a few transerable "experiences" (and obviously skills else how come 0-CoreTeam).
* My first "burn" style experience, When I was five I started going to [Lewes Bonfire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewes_Bonfire) in the UK.
 - That would be about 40years ago now.
 - When I went to my third Bonfire that would mark the year that Larry and Jerry decided to knock up a wooden man to go drag down to a beach 4months and half a world away.
 - One of the few photos I could find that says it's 1986 [https://flic.kr/p/5yxbES]
 - Then there is this... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx0049j_94] The first third of this would have been the same year as the first Burning Man.
 - I do see specifically Lewes Bonfire as very similar to Burning Man. And it's one of those things that superficially when you look at the events, "There is fire and there is large effigy being burnt.", Big whoop. But if you actually look into the history of both events.
   - Both have a history of public mayhem. Burning man with it's origin's with the Cacphony Society, Lewes had the Bonfire Boys. 
   - Both have seen as they expanded the need to subdivide, BM with Themecamps and now Hubs, Lewes with the Bonfire Societys.
   - Both have a very relax attitude to safety.BM's like to burn stuff and the motto "Saftey Third", Lewes.. Well I've not seen anywhere else that thinks launching rockets horizontally in a crowded street or military cadets thinking "borrowing" miltary grade flashbangs to outdo the other societies "banngers". (both things I witnessed first hand.)
   - General links to Counter culture. Obviously Burning Man is quite openly counter culture. And Lewes? Well, The reason Lewes is such a big deal is that in 1605 when a Chap called "Guy Fawkes" filled the basement of parliment with barrrels of gunpowder and almost succeeded in blowing them up. He managed to escape and headed to the south coast in an attempt to get to France. Lewes was where they caught and executed him. (could not have planned this talking of counterculture references) This year will mark the 420th year since that happened. 420years later and his face is still used as a counter culture icon. Thanks to the film V for Vendetta and Anonymous, Guy Fawkes' face is pretty much the face of counter culture.
   - Both locations see an explosion in population during the course of the event.
   - Both have some quite serious things they deal with to. The 10P and the temple for BM...  For Lewes, You might notice in the video that they often stop at a place and put down a wreath then play the Last Post. That is Lewes War Memorial in the center of town. Guy Fawkes night is the 5th of november which is 6 days before rememberance day on the 11th. You also have the Burning Crosses. Obviously in recent times a burning cross has taken on some bad associations in the US. In this case there are 17 of them and they represent the Lewes Matyrs. Protestants who were all burned alive in an act of religious persecution. And on the subject of people carrying burning things, All the things that are being carried and are burning represent an act of rememberance. Basically the exact same thing as the temple messages at Burning Man.
 - Thinking that is enough to show that when you look into things you see the similarities.
* When I was 14-15, I started going to a life coaching course. It's origins stem back to California. There was an awful lot that was very similar to the principles and the ranger handbook.
* When I went to Uni, I got realy into "dance music" and everything associated.
 - Between then and my actually stepping on the virtual play for the first time.
   - Spent a lot of time at festivals, both working and playing.
   - Worked in a very alternative pub.
   - Learnt a lot of circus skills including contact fire staff.
   - I then found Second Life in 2005:
     - Potentially the first person to make "virtual drugs".
     - Was very active on the clubbing scene.
     - I had a business making "Glowy Club Toys".
     - I ran a club on an island I had.
   - I started working with this lady called "Poid". One random day she says something along the lines of "Hey I do this thing, we kinda need someone with your abilities, You want to come take a look?". And so a teleport later I first stepped onto the virtual Playa.
   - Those two years were hands down my favourite time in Second Life and have many many good memories.
   - They also led to a lot... e.g. Due to working in close proximety to Lindens and them seeing the way I worked I got a strong suggestion I should apply to be a mole... which I did and so became Protean Mole.

 * Then fast forwards to my recent activities at the Burn.
 * I am at this openstage location and this fairy on a unicorn shows up. A series of spooky coincidences later I find myself teleporting to the Playa again.
 * At that point it seemed perfect timing.
   -  I really needed somewhere safe to find my feet again as,
     - I'd had a rough time at a roleplay sim with emotional abuse and cruel games.
     - I'd just been rejected for mentors (huge can of worms.. )
 * What I did/got for/from Octoburn was:
   - A much needed exhibition of trust by a certain fairy.
   - A nasty shock over how hard streaming was.
    - I got to hand over the DMV rezzer from 09 which contained many missed vehicles.
    - I tried offer my scripting services... "Script Clinic".
    - Almost got a holy grail of certain fields in SL with Animated projections...
    - I tried offer up a couple different activities for people to take part in with a snapshot challenge and the artcar remix challenge.
    - Made a Sim Border to go around the outside of the sim.
    - Built a secondary Ice place.
    - Populated the majority of the public camping area and the RV areas.
    - Learn an entire new skill.
    - DJ'd for the first time in public.
    - Helped in rescuing the metrics system for the event. (One of the requirements from BM)
 - But I had very explicitally said "I was up for helping anywhere I was needed but I couldn't at that time actively ask..."
   - First thing I actually applied for was almost a mistake.
     - I had wanted to share my annoyance on something and had applied for the Asst RC position with an application purely designed to voice that.
     - To my suprise I was actually asked for an interview.
     - I explained why the application had been like it had and said I was going to take things serious from that point onwards.
     - That interview organised for the week after never actually happened.
   - The next thing I "Kind of" applied for... I threw out some suggestions for a Burn at the Equinox, and that resulted in "That sounds great your doing the burn then?" Errr I guess...
     - So My Burn effigy was all about rebirth and unity. Everything about it was mean to represent that.
       - Having people "participate" in the Burn...
       - Requiring them to dance with fire toys (self expression) to actually light the effigy (Communal effort).
       - There was a huge amount more... what was seen was only 25% of what I had planned for it...
       - I was distracted during the build process as Puddles, my friend, had been singled out, ganged up on and was temporarily removed from the event.
       - It REALLY made building something with the message I was trying to present difficult...
       - Puddles was one of the people you can thank for me actually putting anything up at all as there was hours of conversation where she was convincing me to carry on.
   - So never applied for the obvious dpw because I (just for this role) didn't want to appear like I was throwing my weight around.
   - Then the last thing I applied myself to..
     - Standing up for the inclusive discord system and Puddles...

Going to cut that short there. I could obviously go so much further with this... But I think this probably shows what I wanted to show. I.e. I've been a burner for a while now and that "let it go..." those lovely three little words are asking a little more than most people realise.

So, if you find yourself wondering why I refuse to let this go. It's because It's just not who I am and as I said to the second Ranger..

> You do realise that my level of upset is a function of how much I care about virtual burns right? What's the standard greeting amoungst burners? Welcome home... where else do i find that in SL....
