# Talia's Commentary

Mostly this can be summed up with for someone what has absolutley no voice what so ever with this up comming event there is a remarkable amount I seem to have some voice in.

So the most voted upon theme for the event... 

> /[2024/12/12 21:13/] Miranda (MirandaNomad):
>
> Concept:
> Inspired by the Northern Lights, this theme celebrates unity, connection, and the magic of shared experiences. Like the auroras, individual contributions blend to create a magnificent whole. The focus is on how individual creativity and energy come together to form a collective, beautiful phenomenon.
> 
> Visual Style:
> Dynamic auroras created using particle effects that light up the sky in vibrant colors.
> 
> Ground-level holographic art installations and glowing pathways that guide participants to community-built spaces.
> 
> Light-emitting sculptures and interactive art pieces that respond to touch or movement, symbolizing the ripple effect of connection.
> 
> Activities:
> Light-Painting Workshops: Guests use interactive tools to “paint” temporary light trails in shared spaces, contributing to a collaborative art piece.
> Group Meditations Under Auroras: Participants gather in open areas to relax and connect beneath shimmering light displays.
> Musical Performances Synced with Light Shows: Live music synced to


Sooo "Magic of Unity, Connecntion and Magic of Shared Experiences..." "Individual contributions adding up..." "Individual crreativity and energy come together to form a collaborative, beautiful phenomomenon."
Is it just me or is that the community saying what they have been censored in actually saying? Under the threat of being banned themselves no one can actually speak out in mine of any other recent banned avatar. They are actually restricted from following the 10 principles.

As to visual style... Who more so than most does it sound like people are asking for?

OctoBurn23:

* Working on animated projection lighing...
* Had Moap Trippiness across their ground...
* Had a permanent fireworks display to paint the sky with light...
* "Burnt" their camp down in a mushroom particle cloud visable across the player...

NYE: 

* Fireworks display...

Equinox Burn:

* The Unburn which was specifically about bringing people together... With custom particles and many other things... 

Other:

* Suggesting the caustic projection light system as an alternative for the pirate build.
* Because of a certain lead when deciding I wanted to take up DJ'ing, I made the decision that I should do VDJ'ing as well. You know to be radically inclusive.

Since Ban:

* Working at Decadance doing a projection lighting system over the entire front of a big building
* Working at The Gathering making 60m tall weather effects...
* Many random particle systems since...


  And to Reiterate... How can anyone voice their thoughts that my ban was unjust... or voice their opinion that they think it should be reassessed? That is an instant ban. (Against 10 principles.)

I should also mention I have no idea who put forwards the Aurora proposal.. But I do know that the same person also submitted, The Frozen Reverie finalist. I do know who submitted the other suggestion and I can tell you straight away their opinion on the ban. 

> /[2024/12/12 21:21/] Miranda (MirandaNomad): found it interesting that several submissions were very simliar in thought and theme
>
> /[2024/12/12 21:22/] Zoren Manray: yeah several were

One final time, Remember people have had their self expression restricted in terms of saying anything about the bans, aka restriction of participation.

So what else do we have... iSkye after cancellation of meetings again.. For some reason sunday meeting only talks about sunday meetings and thursday only talks about thursdays... for the holidays... where peoples schedules are different to normal.

> /[2024/12/12 21:31/] Jeff Olhoeft (jolhoeft): 3V and I are working on the end of the year reports for BMorg. They have moved the deadline up to Dec 31, so it's a bit more of a scramble this year.

Wonder what could have caused that? Any chance of someone pointing out all the issues to regional in terms of how badly Burn2 adhere to the regional agreement and how the RC is forced into position where they are required to break their contract? Someone who might have already provided a whole load of statistics. That wouldn't have anything to do with this ? 

Fairly certain that you don't have traffic figures as that hasn't been mentioned as yet. Well, Except for me banging on about the 39% drop of traffic between 23 and 24.... And feel free to try disprove that I have stats on that because if necessary I can provide my figures and explain my methodology of their acquisition for which I didn't put a single burner at risk of being banned nor did I do anything that meant I went against anything I was disallowed by the wording of my ban. 

> /[2024/12/12 21:41/] Jeff Olhoeft (jolhoeft): Next year we'll gather it ahead of time now I now what is needed.

Shame there wasn't someone there that had made 6 separate metrics systems for Virtual Burns... 

> /[2024/12/12 21:41/] Jeff Olhoeft (jolhoeft): Although the BMorg seems to change what they want every year.

Well, This year is a little different as they had someone pointing out which rocks they need to look under for MOOP.

> /[2024/12/12 21:43/] Miranda (MirandaNomad): We are definately making progress, working thru the items one by one and making sure the text is clear concise and understandable.
> 
> /[2024/12/12 21:43/] Miranda (MirandaNomad): the team is working well together

So Dr Dave, Lyric and Miranda are on that team. Still Dying to take a look at that... By-Laws was the first team I said I was interested in helping out with. I expressed interest then heard nothing back, The next thing I heard from them was being told at the conclusion to the Radical Inclusion Survey Team (Another team I was apparently excluded from ) that the only way my ban would be looked into would be if those By-Laws went through. After that I spent 40 hours to put together a set of By-Laws just to see how long it would take. After working out that time frame I put them forwards... Waited... Basically got no response what so ever. Knowing how long it took me to put together a complete set of by-laws set a benchmark. 
We are two days away from 4 months since I first publicly posted my By-Laws.. [https://gyazo.com/9a1f730627e48ac36543dda788c43333] 

> /[2024/12/12 21:45/] XiledSol: Does anyone have a question they would like to ask the bylaws members before we move on?

Yes... So Many...

> /[2024/12/12 21:45/] XiledSol: Alright, last topic. New Years Eve
> 
> /[2024/12/12 21:46/] XiledSol: I have put out a call for performers for that night.
> 
> /[2024/12/12 21:47/] XiledSol: If you know some DJ's that have performed here before, let them know we have openings for that night if they aren't already busy

Sooo random little thing, The recent Gathering event... They had a dj competition. They were short dj's for that night. I offered to run through my friends list and ask dj's I knew that were online... A random saturday night... I'd asked 10 different djs before we got enough. I'd not even been through half my list.
