> \[2024/12/15 09:15\] iSkye Silvercloud (iskye.silverweb): the agreement was to cancel the 26th meeting - that's the Thursday after xmas day

Sooo Boxing day?

> \[2024/12/15 09:16\] iSkye Silvercloud (iskye.silverweb): and then asked about cancelling the meetings on either the 22nd or 29th, the Sunday meetings and the suggestion was to bring that here and let the Sunday folks decide

Dumb question... You have an event planned for NYE right? Might it not be a good idea to have a meeting the 29th specifically so that any last requests etc get a chance to be aired before that event? Like don't schedule agenda items for anything but the NYE event... Just Saying.... 

> \[2024/12/15 09:29\] ღ Lïlÿ Vøn ℳᴀɢɪcღ (LilyVonSchtupp): Next topic is Gifts Tent YEar-end cleanup

Spoiler alert later in this meeting Huntress complains about not liking being steamrollered. 

> \[2024/12/15 09:30\] Huntress Catteneo: like to do a clean out start fresh with the new year
> 
> \[2024/12/15 09:31\] Huntress Catteneo: there is stuff that breaks the rules, old stuff, old themes
> 
> \[2024/12/15 09:32\] Huntress Catteneo: really needs a restart

Okay sooo at this point I am already thinking archive it all... make a device that people could drop gifts into there are many potential options. Burners are creative people... And Gifting is one of the principles...

> \[2024/12/15 09:32\] iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): We don't currently have a gifts curator who would really handle that

Oh what happened to the last one?

> \[2024/12/15 09:32\] Huntress Catteneo: I am happy to get it set with new year

Wait, so this is happening?

> \[2024/12/15 09:33\] Huntress Catteneo: send msg to ppl saying stuff returning but feel free to do new things

"Oh Hi! We're bored of the stuff you made and then gifted... But feel free to give us more!"

> \[2024/12/15 09:33\] iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): I like that idea

With the exception of Bee jumping in with the obligatory "burn it"... 
First comment. iSkye jumps in with a seal of approval. Seeding how this conversation should go.
Probably my fault... I pointed out how she was trying to gas light last month so she's falling 
back to her old faithful tactics.

> \[2024/12/15 09:33\] ღ Lïlÿ Vøn ℳᴀɢɪcღ (LilyVonSchtupp): Think you are right
>
> \[2024/12/15 09:34\] ღ Lïlÿ Vøn ℳᴀɢɪcღ (LilyVonSchtupp): time to freshen things up
>
> \[2024/12/15 09:34\] ღ Lïlÿ Vøn ℳᴀɢɪcღ (LilyVonSchtupp): If you need help, let me know

Really have to wonder after you throw out all the old gifts... and the call goes out for people to give again. How many people are going to answer? 
I would have thought given the recent exodus it would be a more sensible idea to actually work out how many new gifts you could get before removing the old ones. Not going to look great to have those tables practically bare or populated by a couple people. 
Those tables really are going to be a test of community support. 
And yeah I've already been over there and grabbed a complete listing of the gifts that are there. 
So, yes, If you do go through with this I will be able to give you statistics based on how many gifters and gifts you had before and after. 

> \[2024/12/15 09:34\] iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): there are some gifts that are 'timeless' - and some that are clearly old, and could be either updated or just removed

Oh another tactic seems to be give an opinion and then step it back. First comment is what is wanted and then second it to step back to middle ground. 
Let everyone else take the hint and get on board before actually committing.

> \[2024/12/15 09:34\] Huntress Catteneo: some stuff has links to sims not here ar Oct oriented

So remove it rather than asked people to correct?

> \[2024/12/15 09:35\] ღ Lïlÿ Vøn ℳᴀɢɪcღ (LilyVonSchtupp): do we have a spreadsheet already somewhere listing them?

I doubt it but there is someone who will very soon.

> \[2024/12/15 09:35\] Huntress Catteneo: just checking if folk are happy for it to be done and then if happy for me to do

Current count: 4 agree 5 no comment.

> \[2024/12/15 09:35\] iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): I don't think Huntress is proposing to remove everything - just the ones that she described, as clearly old, outdated, not within rules (off-playa links, etc.)
>
> \[2024/12/15 09:35\] iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): right, Huntress?

"people ain't jumping on the bandwagon... guess I didn't step back to center enough".

> \[2024/12/15 09:36\] Huntress Catteneo: no matter what there will be some unhappy ppl

"Dammit Huntress!" 
There is soo much to pick apart in that statement. 
Firstly... "Some" surely that is quite a critical factor here... 
Secondly... Does there actually have to be?
Break it down. 
The problem is that there is outdated, improper and unused stuff in the gifts area. 

Who are the stakeholders in this? (in ascending order of numbers)

* Huntress who apparently takes exception to this...
* Me for some reason... read on...
* The Leads who should probably be aware that the state of that area is a direct reflection on how things are going.
* The Gifters who in the spirit of Burning Man gifted items.
* The Burner Community both present and future who could be recipiants of those gifts.

So established who is involved keep those people in mind...

> \[2024/12/15 09:36\] Gin (GinHama): i say go for it Huntress, get copy's of everything and them return what needs to be returned.

Of people present 5 now agree...  Just reached a majority in one of two meetings. 
I am really going to have to run through all the meeting logs and look at what has happened to attendance over time. 
Who attends, total figures etc etc.

> \[2024/12/15 09:36\] ღ Lïlÿ Vøn ℳᴀɢɪcღ (LilyVonSchtupp): that is why it would be good to inventory before deleting or sending back. obvious outdated stuff. no problem

Sooo Grabbing the stuff that you want to keep and setting it up into new givers... 
Just a point here... It's most the stuff fairly open permissions? So couldn't a 2022 NYE be repurposed to a 2025 NYE hat?

> \[2024/12/15 09:37\] iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): yes that should be gifts curator's responsibility so it would be nice to have someone able to do that

Weird your having so many issues getting positions filled.... 

> \[2024/12/15 09:37\] Huntress Catteneo: happy job to fill
>
> \[2024/12/15 09:37\] iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): otherwise piling more and more work on a few people

So you do realise that one of the clauses in the regional agreement is that a regional is not just for a couple theme camps.
That is one thing I might have pointed out to Regional... That basically your driving camp after, camp away. 
I heard something recently that I am not at liberty to discuss but you're going to love it when you hear about it. 
I would pay money to be there when you find out... 

> \[2024/12/15 09:38\] Suzie (SavannahSuzie): like iSkye said, some of the old things are timeless

Not to put words in peoples mouths but that appears like a very cautious acceptances as to the direction of this project. As there was neither a yes or no I'll say abstain.

> \[2024/12/15 09:38\] iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): so Huntress were you saying you would do the year end cleanup but want someone else to take it on going forward?
>
> \[2024/12/15 09:38\] Huntress Catteneo: yep

So clear everything out and then pass on responsibility to fill it up again?

> \[2024/12/15 09:40\] Bar Tenk: well we could keep it all and only put the curated on display... those that offered them might not feel valued if they are returned

Again very cautious acceptance.... abstain.

> \[2024/12/15 09:41\] iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): ideally they could be given to PlayaDustAngel who could then put them out and remove as needed

Funny coincidence.... The third Burn related image I ever shared, is this [https://www.flickr.com/photos/talia_tokugawa/2777699297/in/dateposted/] I would guess I also would probably be within the top five of the number of burn related items in inventory.

> \[2024/12/15 09:41\] Huntress Catteneo: ok headed down the oh no road so I will just list what needs going and table it

Oh so it's happening then?

> \[2024/12/15 09:41\] Suzie (SavannahSuzie): only by date, not by how fun or useful
>
> \[2024/12/15 09:42\] Bar Tenk: still we should value the contribution ... keep it all... perhaps a (eternally delayed) expo of them all....
>
> \[2024/12/15 09:42\] ღ Lïlÿ Vøn ℳᴀɢɪcღ (LilyVonSchtupp): Think going forward, tracking of gifts put out would be a good idea, that way we can rotate things out of the display. Listing all items,
> 
> \[2024/12/15 09:42\] Zoren Manray: heh could have a dispenser of all the old stuff

Or maybe people are feeling a little steamrolled here....

Followed by a whole series of comments of ways to deal with this... then...

> \[2024/12/15 09:46\] Huntress Catteneo: who is paying for snap?
>
> \[2024/12/15 09:46\] iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): Huntress has a good point
>
> \[2024/12/15 09:46\] iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): someone has to take photos, upload - costs lindens

Think at this moment iSkye suddenly realises what the answer to this is... 
There might be someone who gets free uploads... Someone who has numerous times offered to make use of that for Burner purposes... Someone who might have been banned for no good reason... 

---

Not finished by a long shot but been under the weather... soo this is how far I got.
The TLDR; little annoyed with Huntress getting snarky over missing 1 meeting... having been unjustly banned for over 250 days now if there had been meetings for that entire time I would have missed 72
