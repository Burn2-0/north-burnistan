### iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): want to push it back to 31st - 2nd? 🤔

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): I um have an opinion about this pre-building 🧐

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): there were some people who did GREAT at Octoburn and other events -- where they built on site 😅

>  ((cough cough script clinic..))

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): and interacted with each other 🥲... 

>  (( cough cough pretty much talked to everone at 23...  yoyu know with average daily online time of 16-18 hrs.))

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): that's what we really want 🙂‍↕️​

 iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): instead of plopping a complete build down 🙂‍↔️
 


> ((Oh you mean something like someone who turns up with out a clue what they are going to do and had their camp just naturally evolve...??))

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): I've seen more people doing that the last few events, but I'd like us to encourage that 😊

> ((Sooo you'd like to encourage that kinda thing... the kinda thing that is pretty much what people saw me do at 23....  I would suggest not banning the people that are what you describe as ideal behaviour... ))

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): and one way is to have activities during the build period too 🥸

> (( Ohhhh you mean like the Artcar remix thing I was trying to run... or the snapshop only photo challages? ))

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): ok so dates 😅

#### iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): 31 Jan -2 Feb? 🙂‍↕️

> ((It's cause you miss me isn't it... Your subconscious just had you describe what I did for octoburn23... and you lost track of the conversation... ))

ღ..Lyric..ღ (lyricsheart): actually the majority picked the first weekend,

* [X] Laurelle

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): I'm putting out some info and I hope that helps you with those dates 😠

> ((AKA iSkye informs people of what she wants to help they come to the **correct** decision.))

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): so if 24th  weekend is preferred 😤

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): SAY SO. 😩

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): are there MORE people wanting 24th weekend? 😣

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): I just wanted to see a consensus on the date 😒

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): it looks like we have it with 24th 😣

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): no one opposed? 🥺

> (( Someone please oppose this for me... ))

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): in other words, encourage pre-builds. ok 😬

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): just bring 'em, plunk 'em down. 🤢

> ((😤 prepare for more information to help you make the correct decision in 3...2..1..))

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): it's just something I've observed 🧐

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): some people drop a build 😞

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): then never come for the event itself 😠

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): don't even bother to come clean up 😡

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): I'd like to encourage more participation from the builders 🥺

> ((Weirdly enough I do actually agree with iSkye on this... The events are so much better when there is a mutual camaraderie built up during the build periodic... And goes without saying... That last point... How many builders been banned/ alienated/ otherwise chased off....  It would be great to see ALL of their participation wouldn't it??????))

> ((Weird why is it only Cuga that is doing department updates???))

Oh issues with radios? Fnny that... ban the performance lead who dealt with them for you... and someone else whose got a boat load of experience in that field... to such a degree they actually can up with a method to do radios with out plots being cut... sneaky eh?

Miranda (MirandaNomad): are we wanting to be able to use our survey results to show trends/metrics yoy? or is it just for feedback?

> ((Hmmm metrics... did you have those? or you going to fall back on the 39% traffic drop that I managed to establish?))

Huntress Catteneo: surveys will trigger certain parties again

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): oh sure they will but that's not our problem 😒

Huntress Catteneo: use of emails rah rah

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): we will see some positive we may get some negative and some haranguing and whatever 😩

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): we can sort the useful data from the not so useful data 😑


iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): demand email address or demand valid avatar name? 😠

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): or both? 🧐

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): we're not going to follow up by email 😤

Huntress Catteneo: I always hate giving email anywhere

ღ Lïlÿ Vøn ℳᴀɢɪcღ (LilyVonSchtupp): that way we get away from the mess from the data breach

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): and I can have the form disappear and some overlay ext "thank you for your input on this survey! happy day!" whatever.. 🤓

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): so they wont even need confirmation email 😑

ღ Lïlÿ Vøn ℳᴀɢɪcღ (LilyVonSchtupp): we need some safeguards in place id we are asking for emails

> ((Good idea Lily.. now who do you know that is knowledgeable about Data Protection... That Dealt with leads acquisition for 6 years professionally.. i.e. dealt with everything involved in handling peoples data securely and safely? ))

> ((Soo  The person responsible for the data-breach that exposed 335 peoples emails and attached that to their avatar names is still desperate to acquire more email addresses.
> I am wondering if Huntresses comment about being triggered by surveys was directed at me. 
> The reason I have found surveys triggering.. Is  because with RIST (RADICAL INCLUSION yada yada) I was excluded twice.. 
> I was also a little put out as I pretty much did surveying professionally for 6 years.. What the RIST team took months to accomplish was pretty much a mornings work for me. 
> And at the Time Rist was used as a Wait till later thing.. Much like By-Laws has been... 
> Which is another secretive group that I've been excluded from..  But if those comment were aimed at me... Cheers... 
> In other news just two hours before tonight which when I went onto the spreadsheet to check on the agenda I realised that the minutes for the 14th had been posted... SO a couple hours before I found out you made that comment... I'd said this in a burner related group.. 


>Random thought... and not what I was trying to talk to the ever silent Dr D. about...It might work it might not... but why not have the By-Laws team make no decisions with the exception of what questions need to be answered by the resultant by-laws... instead prepare a questionnaire so that each thing that needs addressing has a multichoice/other to it. Would be pretty simple to setup once the actual questions and multi-choices are worked out, and it would be a method of getting a true sense of what the current community actually thinks....it would also mean that everything is already broken down into the important aspects...

> So yeah I hate surveys and they really trigger me...  oh only they are done so badly they expose people emails for 4 years... I do find that rather alarming.

> Okay So one other thing... You can exactly how much disccussion when into the whole 24th or 31st date thing... And iSkyes "Oh yeah I was the 24th..... Butttt... " 
> (just went back highlighted the gas lighting...  guess it should be expected... Maybe you should skip using Gas for your lamps.... either go back to paraffin or just go straight for electric.)


 **iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): last Thursday's meeting we talked about setting dates and themes for the 4 events in 2025**😇

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): and the Thursday committee wanted to concentrate on Winter Burn first🧐

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): so we had 2 dates proposed🙂‍↕️

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): 24-26 January, 31 January - 02 February 😳

#### iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): the Thursday night crew leaned more to the and of January weekend🤥

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): end*😳

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): kind of bounced back and forth then settled on the 31st-2nd 🤥

ღ Lïlÿ Vøn ℳᴀɢɪcღ (LilyVonSchtupp): MAjority leaned more toward 1/24 weekend

iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): what? 😇

#### iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): I thought they leaned to last weekend? 🤥


> (( Seriously, It was over a week for you to post the notes from the 14th. There was a very distinct lack of meeting meetings before you tried this. 
> As I said I did agree with iSkye's reasoning. But her methods here... shocking... ))
