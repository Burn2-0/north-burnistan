# Talia's Commentary

Meeting on the 8th, minutes posted on the 8th!!

> \[2024/12/08 09:06\]  Leondra Larsson: 2\. We take turns.   
>  Meetings are conducted in text.  
>  NOTE: local chat is recorded by notetakers at meetings, and is often shared between Burn2 leads for informational purposes.   
>  If you wish, you can IM the notetaker and ask for your name to be redacted from your comments on meeting notes.  
>  Topic discussions can flow freely, but if chat gets too fast or heated, the moderator for the meeting may ask that we slow down.   
>  TY all. We need to demonstrate the change we want to see. We all need to try to be extra polite, fair, and truthful to head off the contemptuous behaviors of others. Arguing, making >  "dare me" statements, or telling others to "shut up", is not the way to make changes. I do not believe we should tolerate that behavior in others or ourselves.  

"Extra polite, fair and truthful..." Should I run through how I was was banned and restricted from appeal for my first "offense" which I have debunked all the points of, and yet nothing has been done about that... No One has explained why the ban still stands. No one has explained anything... 
I "Argue" because I don't see how things went down as being Fair or Truthful. I make "Dare Me" statements because certain people don't have the politeness to actually talk to me. 
I have no choice but to tolerate your behaviour... that behaviour being Radical exclusion without consent. 
Your nice little addition to the rules there sounds nice... but it's just a get out clause for yourself.

> \[2024/12/08 09:10\]  iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): but there are so few of us here today, that perhaps that should be for next Thursday/Sunday meetings?  

That would be 5 people total. Things are not clicking are they? Your behaviour is not acceptable. People are leaving because of it. 83% of volunteers and performers over 4 years as the databreach showed and you lost 39% of traffic between Octoburn 23 and Octoburn 24.

> \[2024/12/08 09:08\]  iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): this doc:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ycbfUa5FX68uOPHaFbkq9rPAP9uT-v1wzhqKLMYnx0o/edit?usp=sharing

Okay so your list of volunteers:
 * Leo
 * Miranda
 * Magi
 * Lily
 * Gin
 * Bar

Your list of staff: (Although I do notice that this is a really old version of the staff list.)
 * Xiled
 * Cuga
 * Halix
 * Suzie
 * iSkye
 * 3v
 * ParkerB
 * Harlo
 * Leo
 * Freia
 * Apollo
 * Maia
 * Huntress

You have a notable Lack of DPW or Performance on that list... So they are going the way of the Art Dept?

Oh and I noticed that having a each event on separate pages might well be best for quickly seeing each event but it does also mean that you can't easily see trends over time which would obviously not be good to see if you were to be haemoraging volunteers continuously. 
Sooo Obviously I made a version of the volunteer spreadsheets that shows a years worth of events and I did a little colour coding.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17zr7enPzXdxnSUFYY2pq858-zJ0CfVTyPfYGrsYMbZY/edit?usp=sharing

Not keen on the UI you have for the winterburn entries, needlessly putting them on separate tabs? Majority of the entries are barely a paragraph of text. Guess what! I made it into a single list so it's easier to see. Oh and I note the lack of the Grinch Themed one...

## Aurora Mystica: Lights of Connection

Concept:
	Inspired by the Northern Lights, this theme celebrates unity, connection, and the magic of shared experiences. Like the auroras, individual contributions blend to create a magnificent whole. The focus is on how individual creativity and energy come together to form a collective, beautiful phenomenon.

Visual Style:
	Dynamic auroras created using particle effects that light up the sky in vibrant colors.

Ground-level holographic art installations and glowing pathways that guide participants to community-built spaces.
	Light-emitting sculptures and interactive art pieces that respond to touch or movement, symbolizing the ripple effect of connection.

Activities:
	Light-Painting Workshops: Guests use interactive tools to “paint” temporary light trails in shared spaces, contributing to a collaborative art piece.
	Group Meditations Under Auroras: Participants gather in open areas to relax and connect beneath shimmering light displays.
	Musical Performances Synced with Light Shows: Live music synced to dynamic light effects, creating a multisensory experience of sound and visuals.

## Cold Flame

White hot fire burning with a bright blue flame.

## Creatures of the Snow

The frost on the trees, the snow on the ground, the nip in the air are all there because of the winter sprites and fairies and likewise creatures.

## Crystalis

In Winter the crystals form and from that cold beauty emerges a new world.

## Diamonds on the Desert

In the heart of the desert, where we will play,<br>
A shimmering spectacle emerges, clear as day.<br>
Ice crystals dance, reflecting the sun's embrace,<br>
A frozen oasis in an arid space.
Like diamonds scattered across the sand,<br>
Ice crystals sparkle, at the moon's command.<br>
Their beauty belies the desert's fierce heat,<br>
A testament to nature's ability to repeat.
Yet, even in its ephemeral state,<br>
The desert's diamonds leave a lasting fate.<br>
They remind us of beauty's fleeting grace,<br>
And the intricate dance between time and space.
This theme highlights the extraordinary transformation of a desert landscape through the arrival of snow and ice crystals, showcasing the dynamic and interconnected nature of our planet's climate systems. Precious, and to be treasured like diamonds.

## Dusty Snow Globes

Really it feels like we're still stuck in bubbles every winter due to the cold and rain. So why not make the theme snow globes?
Theme would be everyone creates a giant snow globe and builds a little world in it.. it would just be a dusty playa, snowy tundra, rainy marsh, peaceful sunset. Really whatever you can imagine. Keep the globes clear or possibly make a background scene to truly encapsulate yourself. This is not Octoburn after all, so playa aesthetics need not apply.
So let’s have fun creating wonderful and magical snow globe bubbles! But always remember to stay inclusive and welcome as many as we can into those bubbles to enjoy it all together.

## Equinox Burn

Sun and moon as both together as one side sun and other moon sim wise

## Fractured

Mostly artworks in mid-explosion. Or deconstructed, about to go together. Or some probably interpret it as a moment of heartbreak.
With winter in mind, maybe life images in shards of ice. Pattern/photo across snowflakes. snow games to rebuild something.

## Frostlite

Like frostbite, but lighter, and your toes don't fall off.

## Frozen Reverie: Echoes of Fire and Ice

Concept:
	A dreamlike fusion of winter’s chill and the Burn’s fiery spirit. Participants can explore the duality of fire and ice through art, builds, and performances, symbolizing contrasts like warmth in the cold, light in darkness, and life amidst stillness.
Visual Style:
	Ethereal icy landscapes with glowing fire pits, shimmering auroras, and sculptures blending frosty and fiery elements.
Activities:
	Ice skating around art installations, storytelling by virtual bonfires, and “Fire vs. Ice” costume parades.

## Gemütlichkeit: A Cozy Winter Escape

## Hellfreeze: Idioms of Impossibility

Hellfreeze: Idioms of Impossibility
Welcome to Hellfreeze: Idioms of Impossibility, where the improbable becomes the inspiration, and the impossible ignites the flame of creativity. In this frosty underworld, where even the Devil might don a pair of skates, we invite you to explore the strange, whimsical, and surreal landscape of ""what will never be""—or so they say.
From the ridiculous to the sublime, idioms of impossibility dare us to imagine the unimaginable. When Hell freezes over, what do you see? Do pigs sprout wings and glide gracefully through a sky heavy with snow? Does a calendar finally make space for the Thirtieth of February? Do you brave the treacherous tundra in search of hen’s teeth? Or perhaps you simply pause to marvel at the serene absurdity of a snowball surviving its impossible journey.
Hellfreeze is an invitation to defy expectations and create worlds that twist reality into delightful knots. It's about celebrating the unthinkable and reveling in the absurd. Your camp might explore the humor and wit of these idioms, crafting whimsical sculptures or interactive installations that play with the futility of finding a needle in a haystack—or perhaps you’ll tell stories of the long-anticipated Twelfth of Never finally arriving.
This is a realm where art, fire, and frost collide. Imagine icy landscapes that glow with the warmth of shared laughter, frozen rivers flowing with impossible dreams, and frosty air filled with the crackle of creativity. Whether you build a flying pig farm, stage a circus for herding cats, or craft the impossible geometry of a squared circle, Hellfreeze is a space for wild dreams and wondrous impossibilities.

## Kittens with Mittens

According to Mother Goose:
The three little kittens, they lost their mittens, And they began to cry!
They go on to find their mittens and have some pie, but the sad initial image of the poor crying kitties needs to be tempered with some good old-fashioned Burning. Not burning the kitties, but just...Burning.

## Leapin' Blizzards!

What Little Orphan Annie likes to say, but much, much colder.

## Northern Lights on The Playa

The Northern Lights, Aurora Borealis, appear in a clear night sky as swirling rivers of greenish-blue light. They move and dance unpredictably; sometimes barely perceptible, then suddenly growing vivid. In simple terms, auroras can be explained as an interaction of the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field.

## Once Upon A Snowflake

As snow covers the playa and the sky is clear and crisp, we welcome the start of a new beginning, a new year. The child in all of us comes out when we make a wish on a snowflake. Fantasy replaces reality as we all come together with our hopes and dreams.

## Penguin Paradise

Penguins are fun, so party on the playa like a penguin. Penguins also know how to relax. So party by the Penguin Pool, go Ice skating, tobogganing, and skiing.

## Sculptures

Build a snowman or a sandcastle, head back to a simpler past.

## Soulsearch

First image in my head is like the whimsy theme but darker. Possibly even purposely connected, dark whimsy, whimsy 2.0. Moody colours and mirrors (for "reflection"). But alternatively, representation of the soul journey. Mazes. Slides. Warzone. Love.

## Strandbeest/Kinetic

Moving designs. The strandbeest in RL powers itself by wind and walks across ground. But any design that intermittently moves.

## The Ice Age

The movie and/or the actual ice age.

## Winter Carnival

What is the symbolic meaning of Carnival? Carnival can be regarded as a rite of passage from darkness to light, from winter to spring: a fertility celebration, the first festival of the new year. Winter is driven out, making sure that fertility can return in the spring.

## Winter Getaway

There is a cabin is the woods in a beautiful winter wonder land. There is a chill in the air but the fire place in side is warm and toasty.

## Winter Whimsy

The landscape is coved in a beautiful bower of snow and winter fun is all around you, all you have to do is enter your imagination and dream.

> [2024/12/08 09:32]  Bar Tenk: it's a bit of catch 22...       I mean the theme and teams. right?        eg I like to make the stage as usual ;)     but the "Winter snowglobe"   contains a design already "Main stage is an ice castle with projections that slowly change colors, moods and images. Dance floor is surrounded by ice trees filled with tiny lights."    making it less fun to work with.....   does that mean the the idea-owner will make the stage?

Oh I would totally do and have the capability to make a stage. Not complaining about the stages at all but in the last 4 events Bar made 3 of 4 stages. How is that showing inclusivity?

> [2024/12/08 09:36]  ღ Lïlÿ Vøn ℳᴀɢɪcღ (LilyVonSchtupp): If people feel pressure that if they contribute idea they will have to lead event, we might see some people not come forward with ideas

There is no clarification as to any expection of volunteering on the form requesting ideas. Either that people should expect to show some responsibility for their idea and participate by volunteering or that by suggesting an idea they hold no reason to be expected to participate. Obviously there is the 10p's Participate... but actual communication would be useful in terms of allowing people to know what the expectations are here.

I have to point out Huntress' usual communication on this front. 

> [2024/12/08 09:38]  Huntress Catteneo: I personally don't care, used to fpl not helping

Very much virtue signaling and making other people wrong. It's not condusive to making people "want to help".  So in my case for example her reaction is making me feel like it's my fault for not helping. Pretty sure she know damn well I would help were I able to. But that goes across so many people. There are so many people that would devote so much time out there but it's not because of the work that they are not offereing to help. 
e.g. Last octoburn 39% drop in overall traffic... exactly how many people turned up but only did their own thing rather than offer extra in support of the event based on decisions by leadership?

> [2024/12/08 09:40]  iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): we have all sorts of people in this regional
> [2024/12/08 09:41]  iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): and there's room for the ones who hold back, for the ones who jump in, and all the ones in between :)

Just no room for those who jump in in a way that certain people don't like?

> [2024/12/08 09:43]  Leondra Larsson: and we will always have people who will bring in a forest with a log cabin and pine trees
> [2024/12/08 09:44]  iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): Well there was one suggestion that said "playa aesthetics need not apply"
> [2024/12/08 09:44]  iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): well...
> [2024/12/08 09:44]  iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): M2 stipulated at one point that the playa ground should remain visible regardless

Sooo Could I just remind you of my making complaints about a certain pirate party. You know the one where I complained about the the fact that the build took up the majority of deephole. Not only covering the playa ground itself but even built up walls to hide the surrounding mountains as well?
You know the one where I built a demo of how to use projected lighting to emulate the effect of water over the top of the playa texture?
The one that led me to put forward the proposal for the multi level solution? Where there would be different levels that would... hell I'll just reshare that proposal again... 

---
I've brought this up a couple times now.. That BM on the open playa is wide and expansive. Operating on a single does not leave a lot of wiggle room for people. Just the other week I made the suggestion to Cuga that it could be position for DMV to have some wide open spaces to test vehicles on or even step races..  
Imagine a main stage on it's on level.. or even just an open playa stage where act that would be more visually taxing didn't almost affect everyone else.  
Or effigy burns… another good example.  
So 4 additional sub levels? we could have:

- ###### Build platform can remain for builds. 3950m

((I would move it right to the top of realistic build heights however 3950 would probably be best.. 4k is where things starting getting squorly so that would provide a good 50m vertical build space.))

- ###### "Regional Burner" level 3180m

    We could emulate Kiwi burn or BC burn (Or pirate nights or other stuff that needs to go against build aesthetics),  
((My build that I did After Sundays meeting at 2k is an example of what could be done with this. Entire sim area builds in completely different areas could be used for showing off other regional builds. e.g. Imagine how high pitched a Squee of excitement Neko would make given the chance to do a mini Kiwi burn..? And in rolling lush green hills… Or I believe beach burns are a thing..))

 - ###### DMV for racing and testing, 2380m

((Did submit a notecard to Cuga suggesting this..))

 - ###### Performance level for effigies and larger performances. 1580m

((I did mention this before as a possibility.))

 - ###### Open Playa.. 808m

     For anyone needing a sparse space for Burner Playa stuff.. Drum Circles out on the player for example.  
     Bring back the art department.. and have a large area to display artwork.

 - ###### Ground level - Gerlach and Camps. 26m

((Note the list above goes top to bottom in terms of altitudes. I've also sandwiched them so if goes quiet/sparse to loud/busy to quiet/sparse.))

If we were really sneaky we could do something like have rezzers to hide things unless people needed them. ((waits for the audible gasps and muttered whispers of Lag to subside.))  
Please keep in mind who is suggesting this. Why would I suggest such a heretical thing… Because the biggest factor to lag is exactly how much people have to download in terms of textures.. The amount of avatars with the insane amount of textures they contain, the far that render weights mean that Tri efficiencies goes out the window for attachments and that avatar physics is the biggest contributor for lag there is.  
Your average avatar will also have their draw distance set to around 128ish.. If you split everything into sublevels even 500 m apart means you can easily stop people from needing to download anything more than is needed.  
((The levels I posted on the list supersede the 500m guestimate))
---

You see how that suggestion takes into account peoples desire to build in other styles. Every level in that proposal had someone specifically in mind. I even built out a level as an alternative to how that pirate build was done. That level was Labelled as "My Personal Build". 

Just a quick rundown on how I made that build:

  1. I took prim templates of all the major components of the build at groundlevel which were against playa aesthetics.
  2. I transported those templates to 2000m altitude.
  3. I build an entire sim wide scene based around those templates... Matching the theme "Pirates".
  4. I made sure to build with those templates being considered to be what they were below.
  5. I was quite able to transport and entire build over that 2000m successfully.

So I had "Complained" about a build that hid playa ground and hid everything about where the build was. I had not just complained. I had built out demos of multi alternative options.

Someone who had tried push towards better playa aesthetics, Someone who had not just made the suggestion but put in the work towards all those suggestions. So it was constructive critique in line with build guidelines and as both Leo and iSkye just said were in-line with what leads want.  

And look what that got me? Does that in anyway give people any enthusiasm to actually offer to help?

Oh and insult to injury, My suggestion actually stemmed from my suggestion to the DMV to just make a single level just for them where they could have a track that people could use through out the year. A recent event I was part of that held a very similar aesthetic funnily enough had such a level... check it out.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBIR7u_SSsI The Promo for the event.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TSOGITCaM0 This is the preview of the track.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1J2qapNWCc The Actual Event.

But my putting that forward as a suggestion led to a meeting where I likened the feeling afterwards as being a group of dogs favourite chew toy. Where I was trying to field answers to an onslaught of things people were saying only to have iSkye seeding her preferences on each.  Not being given time to address anything before the next thing came in... Quite litterally a dog pile. There was even one point where it seemed like Leo and iSkye planned whose turn it was to deliver the next kicking.

> [2024/12/08 09:44]  Leondra Larsson: I find that Playa Aesthetics pushes one's creativity

You mean applying restrictions to a particular build helps?
[2023/12/17 09:40:57] Talia Tokugawa: I was wondering about the possibility of "odd" requirements... placeing of weird little rules on build can lead to people having to thing outside the box so to speak and can lead to some creativity that with open requirements you would not otherwise get...

> [2024/12/08 09:47]  iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): primordial - M2 saw that and had a cow because terraformed

Bet you were bricking it in case he logged in for that pirate build? 
But Gin was designated a special case... Just so happened she was a proponent against the discord hookup.  So She was going against build aesthetics... something you have jsut scorned, She's since gone onto become a lead... and where is anyone that spoke up in favour of that proposal that favoured inclusivity?  

Radically excluded. 

And seriously you wonder why people are leaving... Why you have trouble in finding volunteers...  When such blatant favouritism is exhibited so openly... And the fact that you have someone you have banned that is putting in more work towards Burn2 than some of the current leads are and you refuse to even talk to them about it.  You think that is doing you any favours at all?

You can try delude yourselves as much as you want but you know damn well that I am not going to give up on this... I am going to talk with whomever I think might be able to have some kinda effect on this decision no matter how little. At the moment that means working my way through supersuzes podcast and providing commentaries on any that talk about things I don't see within Burn2. 

First topic is to be https://soundcloud.com/burnerpodcast/burning-man-hive
