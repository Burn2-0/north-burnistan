Arguing, making >  "dare me" statements, or telling others to "shut up", is not the way to make changes. I do not believe we should tolerate that behavior in others or ourselves.  

"Extra polite, fair and truthful..." Should I run through how I was was banned and restricted from appeal for my first "offense" which I have debunked all the points of, and yet nothing has been done about that... No One has explained why the ban still stands. No one has explained anything... 
I "Argue" because I don't see how things went down as being Fair or Truthful. I make "Dare Me" statements because certain people don't have the politeness to actually talk to me. 
I have no choice but to tolerate your behaviour... that behaviour being Radical exclusion without consent. 
Your nice little addition to the rules there sounds nice... but it's just a get out clause for yourself.

That would be 5 people total. Things are no clicking are they? Your behaviour is not acceptable. People are leaving because of it. 83% of volunteers and performers over 4 years as the databreach showed and you lost 39% of traffic between Octoburn 23 and Octoburn 24.
