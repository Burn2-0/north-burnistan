---

## Person A:

Obvious these three all came from the same person. They are the only person to have subdivided their suggestions with "Concept", "Visual Style" and "Activities".

### PICK ONE: Aurora Mystica: Lights of Connection

**Concept:
	Inspired by the Northern Lights, this theme celebrates unity, connection, and the magic of shared experiences. Like the auroras, individual contributions blend to create a magnificent whole. The focus is on how individual creativity and energy come together to form a collective, beautiful phenomenon.

Visual Style:
	Dynamic auroras created using particle effects that light up the sky in vibrant colors.

Ground-level holographic art installations and glowing pathways that guide participants to community-built spaces.
	Light-emitting sculptures and interactive art pieces that respond to touch or movement, symbolizing the ripple effect of connection.

Activities:
	Light-Painting Workshops: Guests use interactive tools to “paint” temporary light trails in shared spaces, contributing to a collaborative art piece.
	Group Meditations Under Auroras: Participants gather in open areas to relax and connect beneath shimmering light displays.
	Musical Performances Synced with Light Shows: Live music synced to dynamic light effects, creating a multisensory experience of sound and visuals.
**
### PICK TWO: Frozen Reverie: Echoes of Fire and Ice

**Concept:
	A dreamlike fusion of winter’s chill and the Burn’s fiery spirit. Participants can explore the duality of fire and ice through art, builds, and performances, symbolizing contrasts like warmth in the cold, light in darkness, and life amidst stillness.

Visual Style:
	Ethereal icy landscapes with glowing fire pits, shimmering auroras, and sculptures blending frosty and fiery elements.

Activities:
	Ice skating around art installations, storytelling by virtual bonfires, and “Fire vs. Ice” costume parades.
**
#### Hearth and Horizon: Finding Warmth Within

Concept:
	Inviting participants to create intimate, cozy spaces of warmth and reflection amidst vast winter landscapes, emphasizing self-discovery, community, and resilience.
 
Visual Style:
	Snow-covered plains dotted with glowing hearths, rustic cabins, and lantern-lit trails.
 
Activities:
	Building collaborative “hearth spaces,” storytelling circles, and workshops on finding inner warmth and creativity.

### PICK THREE: Hellfreeze: Idioms of Impossibility

**Hellfreeze: Idioms of Impossibility
Welcome to Hellfreeze: Idioms of Impossibility, where the improbable becomes the inspiration, and the impossible ignites the flame of creativity. In this frosty underworld, where even the Devil might don a pair of skates, we invite you to explore the strange, whimsical, and surreal landscape of ""what will never be""—or so they say.
From the ridiculous to the sublime, idioms of impossibility dare us to imagine the unimaginable. When Hell freezes over, what do you see? Do pigs sprout wings and glide gracefully through a sky heavy with snow? Does a calendar finally make space for the Thirtieth of February? Do you brave the treacherous tundra in search of hen’s teeth? Or perhaps you simply pause to marvel at the serene absurdity of a snowball surviving its impossible journey.
Hellfreeze is an invitation to defy expectations and create worlds that twist reality into delightful knots. It's about celebrating the unthinkable and reveling in the absurd. Your camp might explore the humor and wit of these idioms, crafting whimsical sculptures or interactive installations that play with the futility of finding a needle in a haystack—or perhaps you’ll tell stories of the long-anticipated Twelfth of Never finally arriving.
This is a realm where art, fire, and frost collide. Imagine icy landscapes that glow with the warmth of shared laughter, frozen rivers flowing with impossible dreams, and frosty air filled with the crackle of creativity. Whether you build a flying pig farm, stage a circus for herding cats, or craft the impossible geometry of a squared circle, Hellfreeze is a space for wild dreams and wondrous impossibilities.

Then, This is best guess for the third.

#### A Winter Snowglobe

The playa surface is crystalline ice with a delicate transparent snow globe over the area. Visitors enter the snow globe over an enchanted bridge where they are gifted ice skates and skate AO's.
The vehicles are crystal sleighs, some pulled by snow bears and other winter creatures. There is a path to walk, ride or drive on that spirals up along the edges of the snow globe affording the most amazing views of the magical landscape below.
Main stage is an ice castle with projections that slowly change colors, moods and images. Dance floor is surrounded by ice trees filled with tiny lights.
People are encouraged to dress to their Winter's delight.

## Person C

German references.

#### Gemütlichkeit: A Cozy Winter Escape

"**Burning Man Winter Event: "Gemütlichkeit: A Cozy Winter Escape"**

Embrace the chill of winter and immerse yourself in the warmth of Gemütlichkeit—the German tradition of cozy togetherness! Picture a wood-paneled, glow-filled haven where you’re wrapped in the warmth of good company, hot glühwein in hand, and the air is filled with laughter. At this winter-themed Burning Man event, we’ll transform the cold ino an invitation for connection, comfort, community, and joy. Whether you’re cuddling by the fire, sipping mulled wine, or dancing in the snow, "Gemütlichkeit" is about making the most of winter’s magic—one cozy moment at a time!
Let’s turn the frost into fun, with warmth in our hearts and a bit of frosty flair!


#### Strandbeest/Kinetic

Moving designs. The strandbeest in RL powers itself by wind and walks across ground. But any design that intermittently moves.


---

## Person D

Fairy tale references.

#### Kittens with Mittens

According to Mother Goose:
The three little kittens, they lost their mittens, And they began to cry!
They go on to find their mittens and have some pie, but the sad initial image of the poor crying kitties needs to be tempered with some good old-fashioned Burning. Not burning the kitties, but just...Burning.

#### Leapin' Blizzards!

What Little Orphan Annie likes to say, but much, much colder.

#### Once Upon A Snowflake

As snow covers the playa and the sky is clear and crisp, we welcome the start of a new beginning, a new year. The child in all of us comes out when we make a wish on a snowflake. Fantasy replaces reality as we all come together with our hopes and dreams.

## Person E

Very disney...

## Penguin Paradise

Penguins are fun, so party on the playa like a penguin. Penguins also know how to relax. So party by the Penguin Pool, go Ice skating, tobogganing, and skiing.

## The Ice Age

The movie and/or the actual ice age.

## Diamonds on the Desert

In the heart of the desert, where we will play,<br>
A shimmering spectacle emerges, clear as day.<br>
Ice crystals dance, reflecting the sun's embrace,<br>
A frozen oasis in an arid space.
Like diamonds scattered across the sand,<br>
Ice crystals sparkle, at the moon's command.<br>
Their beauty belies the desert's fierce heat,<br>
A testament to nature's ability to repeat.
Yet, even in its ephemeral state,<br>
The desert's diamonds leave a lasting fate.<br>
They remind us of beauty's fleeting grace,<br>
And the intricate dance between time and space.
This theme highlights the extraordinary transformation of a desert landscape through the arrival of snow and ice crystals, showcasing the dynamic and interconnected nature of our planet's climate systems. Precious, and to be treasured like diamonds.

## Dusty Snow Globes

Really it feels like we're still stuck in bubbles every winter due to the cold and rain. So why not make the theme snow globes?
Theme would be everyone creates a giant snow globe and builds a little world in it.. it would just be a dusty playa, snowy tundra, rainy marsh, peaceful sunset. Really whatever you can imagine. Keep the globes clear or possibly make a background scene to truly encapsulate yourself. This is not Octoburn after all, so playa aesthetics need not apply.
So let’s have fun creating wonderful and magical snow globe bubbles! But always remember to stay inclusive and welcome as many as we can into those bubbles to enjoy it all together.

## Equinox Burn

Sun and moon as both together as one side sun and other moon sim wise

## Fractured

Mostly artworks in mid-explosion. Or deconstructed, about to go together. Or some probably interpret it as a moment of heartbreak.
With winter in mind, maybe life images in shards of ice. Pattern/photo across snowflakes. snow games to rebuild something.




## Frostlite

Like frostbite, but lighter, and your toes don't fall off.

## Cold Flame

White hot fire burning with a bright blue flame.

## Creatures of the Snow

The frost on the trees, the snow on the ground, the nip in the air are all there because of the winter sprites and fairies and likewise creatures.

## Crystalis

In Winter the crystals form and from that cold beauty emerges a new world.

## Northern Lights on The Playa

The Northern Lights, Aurora Borealis, appear in a clear night sky as swirling rivers of greenish-blue light. They move and dance unpredictably; sometimes barely perceptible, then suddenly growing vivid. In simple terms, auroras can be explained as an interaction of the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field.




## Sculptures

Build a snowman or a sandcastle, head back to a simpler past.

## Soulsearch

First image in my head is like the whimsy theme but darker. Possibly even purposely connected, dark whimsy, whimsy 2.0. Moody colours and mirrors (for "reflection"). But alternatively, representation of the soul journey. Mazes. Slides. Warzone. Love.




## Winter Carnival

What is the symbolic meaning of Carnival? Carnival can be regarded as a rite of passage from darkness to light, from winter to spring: a fertility celebration, the first festival of the new year. Winter is driven out, making sure that fertility can return in the spring.

## Winter Getaway

There is a cabin is the woods in a beautiful winter wonder land. There is a chill in the air but the fire place in side is warm and toasty.

## Winter Whimsy

The landscape is coved in a beautiful bower of snow and winter fun is all around you, all you have to do is enter your imagination and dream.
