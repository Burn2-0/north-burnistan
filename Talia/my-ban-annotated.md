# My Ban - Reply iteration 6

> Dear Talia Tokugawa,
> Subject: Burn2 Membership Status 

> I regret to inform you of an important decision that has been made regarding your membership in Burn2. After escalation of recent events following the ban of the avatar DJ Puddles, Burn2 SIM owner & Burn2 Discord owner, M2, has decided to impose a permanent ban on Talia Tokugawa, Sally27 and Bearded Lady. 

Not exactly sure which offense applies to which avatar now.  :S

> "When a ban is placed on an avatar, it is a result of the behavior of that avatar. No other avatar may act as a proxy or a representative for the banned avatar in order to continue the banned behavior. No builds, signage, or communications may be erected, or placed in Burn2 on behalf of a banned avatar. The posting of messages from a banned avatar is a continuation of the banned activity and is in violation of the ban."

Okay.. So New rule.. that I am informed about in the very letter that I receive the ban for it. Great.

> This decision was not made lightly. As a valued volunteer of Burn2, your contributions and involvement have been appreciated. However, several recent incidents have occurred that violate our community guidelines and standards, which are in place to ensure a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment for all members.

Seems fairly light to me... I placed two complaints and then within a couple days I receive a permanent ban, and as 3V said in my conversation after this was delivered. "A ban from M2 is no longer receiving complaints...", Well that is VERY convenient.  
Compare this to how long we were deliberating the discord linkup. Which is practically the fulfillment of one of the 10 principle... That was over 60 days of feeling like someones plaything. Just as it looked like we were getting to a possible resolution. The RIST was formed anyone remember the other item on the agenda that meet?
"Not lightly" is false advertising. I am due another 50 or so days deliberation and random public survey.

> The specific reasons for this decision include:

> Personal directed attacks posted publicly in Discord:
> On 5/12/24, you engaged in posting public attacks on an individual in the Burn2 community Discord server community chat channel which is in direct violation of our Discord community’s code of conduct, which clearly states public personal attacks and inflammatory posts are not ok.

You mean my stating facts around what was very painful incident for me. An incident that I had been to numerous people complaining and warning about for the entire week prior to the actual meltdown point...?
The incident which I believe gets covered on the rangers "Must Report" list...Which neither the ranger involved reported, or the lead ranger Leondra Larsson who I queried if It had been reported. That Lead Ranger Leondra Larsson has denied all knowledge of the event. Lucky for her eh? Has she having found out that a ranger under her neglected to report a "must report" done anything about it?

"Must-report situations are important and the possible ramifications of a failure to report are significant, failure to report one of these situations can result in you being dismissed from the Ranger Department. This is no joke. They’re called “must-reports” for a reason."

> Discord Moderator warning issued:
> On 5/13/24, you received a warning from Burn2’s Discord moderator, Freia, to be mindful of the CoC in reference to your post topics. Reporting inflammatory posts on behalf of a recently banned avatar and spamming server together with banned avatar’s ALTs is also in direct violation of our community’s code of conduct, which clearly states personal attacks and inflammatory posts are not ok.

If you are talking about the mother's day incident... where I had been angrily ranting, then iSkye pointed out it was Mother's Day in the US and that might be why people were not responding. They a couple other people had shared something personal and I had done the same and made peace pretty much as soon as I'd found out it was mothers day, (it wasn't in UK). Fifteen minutes after that came to a close the moderator got in contact made a friendly suggestion that I tone things down in the future.
Furthermore, Isn't this more conviction for a crime that wasn't until the rule within this letter?

> Planning Meeting topic disruptions: On 5/19/24 Talia made multiple meeting topic requests to demand meeting focus of her choice which was the recent ban of DJ Puddles and to bring up an older ban on Shendara Destiny.

Really? Did anyone actually read the chat log of that. I brought up multiple agenda points all at the same time because I have been religiously keeping to 1 agenda point per meeting. But as I had a backlog from prior meets where they were either flat out ignored or placed last in the agenda and then truncated. I had not been told any were rejected so was under the believe that they were all in the pool ready to go. Please do go ready that meeting. I explain exactly why I posted a batch like that. Are you saying I shouldn't participate by calling the leads on their civic responsibilities?

> Disruption to Community Harmony:
Your actions have led to significant disruption and discomfort among other members of the Burn2 community. After previous warnings and attempts at resolution, the pattern of behavior persisted.

Am I doing this proactively or reactively. Have I been to every meeting I can physically manage and have I done everything asked of me. Have I not volunteered for things? I believe my list of things I have Volunteered for amounts to:

* Assistant RC with 3v.
* Event Placement Lead on the EQ Burn.
* Waiting on Repo Wrangler.
* Waiting on 3v decision before considering Lead DPW.
* EQ Effigy Burn.
* B2tv Camera Person.
* Metrics.
* Ranger.
* ByLaws.
* RIST.
* Inside of the WH Build.
* Sim Border Fades.
* Secondary Arctica Build.
* Large amount of the structures at the free camping.
* Assistance at 2 volunteer thank-you parties.
* etc.
* My initial offer upon first arriving was that if there was something that needed doing that was within my capabilities to do I would do it just had to ask me cause at the time I was having issues with asking for roles.

> Our community’s guidelines are established to protect the well-being and harmony of all members. They are designed to foster an environment where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued. The decision to issue a permanent ban is a measure of last resort, taken only after all other avenues for resolution have been exhausted and/or unable to be resolved due to resource load.

So, I put in complaints and then get banned, with absolutely no process. Maybe had there been some process this ban notice wouldn't have been so weak.
Towards the bottom of this you reference the guidelines on bullying and harassment.

Please can you check this letter against teh criteria for bullying. I can save you the trouble if you want. It fulfils all the criteria from my point of view.

> We understand that this may come as a disappointment to you, and we regret that it has come to this point. However, we must prioritize the collective well-being of our community. As of 5/22/24, your access to all community facilities, events, online platforms, and activities will be permanently revoked.

Yes, I am truly disappointed. How can virtual burn have fallen this far? In the short time I was with BL I saw a 45% increase between two events. I come back and it's now 35% of what it once was. I've seen more people resign roles than I have seen them take roles.

It was once something great, it pushed the limit in terms of what was possible, it was the place to be for builders, performers and ARTISTS.
The core team was tight knit and cohesive under the leadership of Dusty. We were all sure in one thing we were there to give the burners ever change we possibly could to burn their brightest.
I would like to think that we succeeded in that.

It was work hard, play hard. I think we probably spent more time building a giant trebuchet that could launch an avatar over multiple sims than we did in meetings.
Did that mean we were disorganized? That we didn't know exactly what was going on at all times? No and I actually had a gesture to do a text expansion on "It's on the wiki!".
Everyone that needed it had access to read and write on the wiki.
Anything else you could possibly need. You guessed it was on the wiki through the ability to add external links and SLURL. That is Radical Self Expression and Immediacy. Enabling participation, communal effort and Inclusively.

So 12 years since then. We have the power of Discord rather than janky Skype conferences and gChat. Google infrastructure is so much better than it was. We are on the cusp of the intelligence revolution.
And so where is Burn2? Pushing the boundaries? Riding the edge of the chaos these times present to us?

If I wanted to put on an event that evening. Nope. have to ideally put in an agenda point for the next meet so 2-3 days maybe to get permission to self-express.
Hell after the ban of puddles in the way it was done how often you thing groups are going to want to put on events. I mean I alone know 3 different groups of people that I could talk to about running popup events. I am also involved in several clubs and open stages. I could probably get a couple dj play the playa every single day at least yet I get restricted to a single proposal per meeting, with 2 meetings per week.

I even get BANNED for bringing up too many items in a meeting... I get BANNED for radical self expression...

So yeah... I am disappointed. I know how good a virtual burn event can be. I am disappointed that in an attempt to try show people how to live radical, free, in the moment. With trust in your fellow burner and love what we are all trying to achieve.

My Octoburn for example. I went from meekly offering to do stock footage for Puddles at burn tv. Being thrown into the deep end of streaming never having streamed before. I participated, I self expressed, I was in the moment. Was it smooth and easy? No But neither is a rollercoaster, but do people ride them? By the end of the 2 weeks of Burning Life and Manifestation I got from never having streamed to using a vdj's stream feeding into the stream I am running from Sansar to make the visuals that are being streamed by the dj to a screen in Sansar burst out the screen by overlaying them. The stream I am making in Sansar is being broadcast into a club in Second Life to be displayed on a screen there where I have Talia recording video from which I am feeding back onto the stream so in the sky of the party in Sansar You have a giant unicorn and fairy towering over massive buildings with an infinite number of worlds behind them.

That is what I see Virtual burn events to be. 

I know it's the playa,

and I know it's not easy to find a deep end...

but for the love of Burny Shit...

Find a Deep end for yourselves and Fucking Jump...

    Trust...

      Yourselves... (Self Reliance)

Oh don't worry, no need to Thank me...

Each iteration of my reply removes more of the negativity from this.

Removing it from me and placing it where it deserves to remain.

Yeah I keep having the negative crap dumped on me, But besides a little just cacophony, I've been getting more positive each day. 

If you wanted to find evidence of anything, is my getting more positive as result of this permanent ban? Surely a ban is a negative thing but I am getting more positive? What could that possibly mean... 

The negativity... the origin of that was not from me 

;)
